Consequently, I decided to make him thirteen years old, thus making the story about four thirteen-year-old kids. There are more references to this number than can be mentioned casually, some of which are serendipitous. Playing cards, which have a good deal of relevance later, are comprised of four suits of thirteen cards each, for instance."

This usually involved pushing somebody out of the way, or committing a crime."

They're visible already. When you look at it this way, interactive stuff isn't that amazing. Outcomes are hiding, and you have to go to the bother of unhiding them, which is kind of a chore. Life is interactive, which is among the reasons it's such a huge pain in the ass.\n\nYou would think that by designating an author-created reader/player to submit commands, the game would start moving along more smoothly. But, no.\n\nThis now somewhat resembles an old Nintendo Power strategy guide, with screenshots of the game and illustrations of the consequences of player actions. If this Flash game ever stumps you online, like you find yourself getting lost in the house, just take a peek in this book for some HOT TIPS, and you will be well on your way to becoming a Power Player. B)\n\n11: Also, who wants to take a piss with that weird clown watching? I doubt John's cool with that.\n\n15: John, please. The plot of Little Monsters is not foreshadowing the existence of mischievous imps in your house. It is CLEARLY foreshadowing the existence of an alien race called trolls about 2000 pages later. Get with the program!\n\n16: Critical point #1: WV, the one typing the commands, knows who John Cusack is, which is weird even for Homestuck. (SEE: UNIVERSAL CONSTANT.)\n\n20: Critical point #2: Dave is referring to the fact that the Ghostbusters are always getting drenched in a particularly mucilaginous brand of spooky slime in that movie, carrying sexual overtones which I think we're in agreement would be a shame and completely unnecessary to bring attention to under basically any circumstance.\n\n22: Spoiler: John never does use the towel to clean up the oil in his room. I admit fully, I let that plot point get away from me.\n\n28: \"God dammit John, that isn't Michael Cera.\"\nReally long term spoiler: In an alternate universe, it literally is Michael Cera.\n\n29: The way the gameplay worked out, most of the time the sprite would follow John so closely they would just overlap. That is one clingy clownsprite.\n\n35: Yes, the cruxtruder is why he is housetrapped, and not the fact that his house is now confined to a small plateau towering over an abyss.\nAlso, he can STILL go out through the back door! Homestuck is frequently host to some of the least literally homestuck children in the history of fiction.\n\n38: \"John: Exchange shitty figurines for palm of pennies and kick in the nuts. Transaction favors you overwhelmingly.\"\n\n40: Hey, whoa, whoa... that last line about elderly wisdom. Foreshadowing anyone???\n\n43: That case full of games: same one used by Death in Problem Sleuth. Wait! Did I make a note about that in the last book? Behold the inevitability of my befuddlement on such matters. I promise, you haven't seen the last of it. Probably half these notes will be me inadvertently repeating book one trivia.\n\n47: Heh heh, John sure does irrationally hate Betty Crocker, the harmless baked goods corporation, doesn't he? Surely this is just a silly running gag and won't come back to haunt us in any significant way. Right? I mean... it just can't... could it? That would be blowing a gag way too far out of propo-oh fuck Crocker's gonna be last boss, isn't she.\n\n51: In retrospect, it's pretty remarkable to examine the breadth of WV's basic understanding of things. He seems to know what a washer and dryer look like, and what they're for. And can give quality advice on when it is or isn't practical to launder your garments.\n\n60: \"Although, he doesn't know what a swing set is. Or damaged power lines. Or an electric meter. Or handcuffs. Or a kitchen.\"\n Maybe I spoke too soon.\n\n64: \"AUTHOR'S NOTE: RE: Cirque du Soleil. Best joke in Homestuck. You may now stop reading, and close the book.\"\n\n65: Follow-up on the peanut allergy issue: I'm pleased to report it does in fact prove to be relevant later.\n\n66: I like to picture dad first hanging that dumbass clown photo straight, looking at it for a while with a vaguely dissatisfied expression, and then tilting it.\n\n76: In these early pages, particularly with the lonely and disquieting ambiance of the walkaround page, there was something that felt deeply troubling about all this strange harlequin shit. Ultimately, the edge was taken off somewhat when it turned out all clownish roads led to a stoned alien juggalo.\n\nOne thing the book doesn't do (or even the site most of the time) is convey how quickly all this stuff was made. This entire walkaround game was made in less than 24 hours, all drawn and written by me, and programmed by Gankro. When you have to write a large amount of text for many different user choices, you start to get very quippy and punchy to just get it all done. But then, that's sort of a stupid way to qualify these pages, since that is how literally every page in Homestuck was written, ever. And also all of these notes."

It then metastasized into a Thing far surpassing whatever it initially had a right to become, which was basically nothing. Primarily because I made the decision to include it prominently as a feature of Homestuck canon, as Dave's ongoing magnum opus. Probably the biggest reason for doing this was to introduce an original work into the story which could serve as a wellspring of humorous references among the kids, which they could recite to each other and joke about frequently.\n\nIt was a deliberate source of in-house memes, and of course enjoyed memetic proliferation in the real world as well. The arsenal of catch phrases and symbols is so extensive, it's almost like a secret language understood by those who trade the terms, and it comes close to being employed this way in a number of Homestuck pesterlogs. It's actually kind of hard to believe how few comics there really are. In almost three years, there are only about 40, which means I (Dave?!) was churning out one of these pieces of shit only about once a month. I think there were Renaissance painters who worked faster. (I.e. hacks)\n\nDave is the author of a comic clearly created by me, because he's basically one of the numerous \"self insert characters\" lurking in Homestuck. Similar in classification to what people call a Mary Sue, though it's not really that simple. The personality profile is not mine, but his jokes and sense of humor are unapologetically my own, with very little filter applied. Much later, his bro is an even more egregious case of this. The fact that they are both explicitly made out to be \"too cool for words\" is just more shameless self congratulation, in the fine tradition of self-insertion. Which is \"part of the joke.\" ;)"

This foam puppet I guess I decapitated earlier when I flipped out in the kitchen. See it. Yeah. This could be you. Just watch your step bro.\n\n0:11 - Professional tip: use the blur filter to make it look like someone is going fast. Am I the first person to ever think of that neat trick? The answer is, almost certainly.\n\nBro is really just pissed at Dave for ripping up the weird Muppet Babies comic that was taped to the door.\n\n0:25 - If a dude is in a sword fight, he cannot be authoritatively identified as an ice cold motherfucker unless he blocks the other guy's sword without even looking.\n\n0:31 - It is also an unwritten rule that in nonlethal sword fights, while all the coolest moves are done through swordplay, any attack that makes any actual bodily contact must be done through punching and kicking. That's because in reality, if a sword slices you, you pretty much just die. And when someone dies, that's when the coolness ends. Although I guess theoretically one of the swordsmen could still sort of leap and cavort around the dead body, flipping out awesomely with his sword and such. That would be one way to prolong an awesome sword fight.\n\n0:35 - Dave was doing alright there for a while, but here's where it all starts to unravel. Don't worry, the training is for your own good, Dave. It comes in handy later when you... uh... I guess when you swindle some idiot crocodiles out of trillions of dollars in the stock market?\n\n0:45 - Let's face facts. This training was pretty much useless.\n\n0:53 - Bro is just standing there with Cal, primed for the knockout blow with his tiny hightop sneaker. Insult, meet injury. Again, hang in there, Dave. You will get your revenge later in the story, by grieving over your older brother's slain bloody corpse.\n\n0:59 - There are many, many references to Sweet Bro and Hella Jeff throughout Homestuck, both visual and textual. Each one serves a very important purpose. That purpose is usually to remind you that Sweet Bro and Hella Jeff exists. Especially if you don't like it.\n"

It's exciting.\n\n0:47 - Look at how I was still switching her shirt logo around even in the middle of a Flash. This is called attention to detail.\n\n1:05 - And there goes the bed. If only the bed could have burned to death on its Quest Bedbed.\n\n1:20 - Look at Dave putting all this stuff in these terrible inconvenient locations. What a jackass!\n\n1:28 - The real hero of Act 3: a 20 foot tall, 10 ton stone statue of Zazzerpan the Learned. Those Zazzerstats are canon btw.\n\n1:41 - Rose was eager to play this game in the first place so she could resurrect her dead cat, AND GOD DAMMIT THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT SHE'S GOING TO DO. All these flaming tornadoes and flying wizards can go to hell.\n\n1:57 - There's this whole spiel on Sburb's \"entry items\" and what they mean, which I won't get into now. But here's another brief spin on it. John's was an apple from a tree, obviously like the one from the bible. In that tale, the apple represented a temptation to Adam and Eve, and trouble was a-lurkin' if they took a bite. In retrospect the liquor bottle similarly represents a kind of temptation in the context of this character arc.\n\n2:31 - Usually with acts in Homestuck, there's something that happens at the end that brings the act back full circle. Act 3 started with Nanna's inscription to John, and here we see when and how that was written, while getting a very brief glimpse of what's under the clouds and thus a peek at the much bigger story waiting for us to discover.\n\n2:36 - One wonders if she was aware Dave had given Jaspers some useful tentacles to bail her out with before she jumped. It was quite a leap of faith. Or just outright suicidal. The Lalondes and Striders are basically all cuckoo bananas. But anyways, let's reflect on the teamwork involved to make everything work. Rose bringing Jaspers back, Dave making him a princess, Jaspers saving Rose... God teamwork is great. So is friendship. If your story isn't in some way basically about friendship and teamwork, you are failing hilariously at your job.\n\n2:50 - In [this part of the] montage we see a very quick rewind of WV blasting off in his big can. Which turns out to be the cork of a huge bottle, the unsurprising shape of the exile station which formed in Rose's crater. Exile station designs are based on the entry item of that location. As if you didn't know that already.\n\n2:58 - Sure cuttin' it close there Rose...\n My characters never listen to me.\n\n3:01 - The thing being revealed here: Dave's copy of the game has been stored in this lotus time capsule for millions of years. WHAT?? Yes, the same juice-stained copies currently on the roof below his window. How do they get here? This is how most mysteries work in Homestuck. You know a thing is going to happen in the future, but you don't know why or how. So you just keep reading, while screaming.\n\n3:02 - The animation just keeps on going, and the song \"Sburban Jungle\" sorta bumps it up a notch. John proceeds to climb his house while kicking imp and ogre ass. There are a few moments in the earlier acts which seem to trick you into thinking Homestuck is all about getting cool gear, gaining levels, and kicking ass like you expect to do in such games. This is kind of misleading though. In totality, HS isn't really about ass-kicking at all. It's about presenting awesome fantasy environments and situations in which ass-kicking could THEORETICALLY take place, but very rarely does except in dramatic hot points like this. Instead, those environments serve as backdrops for a huge amount of dicking around on the internet, babbling to friends about feelings, and being a bunch of stupid useless kids struggling to grow up. If you are ever under the impression HS is about anything else, you are invariably in for a world of hurt.\n\n\n3:25 - The best part of the animation is when John just runs up and clocks a hapless imp in the face. Don't even try to tell me it isn't.\n\n3:29 - Whereas this imp gets inadvertently Cosby'd into the pit. You'd think John would later find the Cosbytop lying around somewhere down there, but I don't think that's what happens. I think he just makes another one?? Why the hell not. The great thing about alchemy is it puts very little premium on almost any single object. Except ones which are Plot Critical to be unique, like the game disc, or the matriorb. It's almost like... the game knows when an item is plot critical?? It's almost like... my brain as the author of the story IS the game???\n\n3:34 - Then John boings into the thing. The end."

Each member either never forgives, or never forgets, or always forgives, or always forgets. Spades never forgives (obviously), Hearts never forgets (holds long-term grudges for any slight), Clubs always forgets (dumb guy, bad memory), and Diamonds always \"forgives\" (but a tongue-in-cheek usage of \"forgiveness\" that kinda means the opposite, much like what Sleuth's \"diplomacy\" meant in Problem Sleuth.) Traces of these characterization points lingered somewhat, but for the most part this idea was discarded and never really elaborated on in any tangible way. EXCEPT HERE."

This one is similar in style to the game when John first enters the Medium and can wander around his house, but this time there's ACTUAL battle mechanics.. You can bonk imps with a hammer, collect grist and items—all rather pointlessly, I should add. But you can do it, is the point. Why? I really couldn't fucking tell you, to this day. I think I was legitimately insane? This, with perfectly brutal honesty, I must admit now strikes me as something a crazy person would do.\n\n >4: I suppose the upshot of the game format is that it lets the player wander around this fantastical new land and discover its mysteries just like John is doing. Actually, YOU don't get to. You get to [click] through this [set of images] with your grubby fingers while I struggle through a borderline state of dementia, heroically trying to remember what I was thinking when I made this. But some people sure did get to do that. Anyway, this is what happens when you click that icon in the upper right. John gets to talk to Nanna, like...there's some sort of comm system back to his sprite? Sprites technically can't go far from the house after their player enters the Medium. That's the strict rule of Sburb. Until much, much later, when it stops being all that strict, for reasons that are unlikely ever to be explained, even by the WISEST of sprites.\n\n >7: Here's a little taste of the gameplay. You click on a thing and a menu pops up, which includes what is...technically a text command that is being entered by...the player of Homestuck? (Who has at this point been revealed to be any given exile, operating the post-apocalypse Sburb station.) It's pretty esoteric. But you don't need to think about any of this to play the game, get a sense of John's rad land, meet some scurrilous foes in need of a bashing, and feel like a cool hero.\n\n >18: The ghost gauntlets holding that ridiculous paisley hammer are just a fixture of the environment in this game. I didn't want them to be an item you could use, because that would have been complicated to implement. It was a little attention to detail on my part, by which I mean my inclination to consider how John could wield this huge hammer in his inventory. Specific items that are accrued by the players become a lot less relevant much later in the story. Because it stops being a thing about a Guy In A Game You Are \"Playing,\" and starts being more about a bunch of Characters In A Story You Are Reading, Who Are Sad All The Time.\n\n >20/23: Here we meet a \"consort.\" Or, a salamander, in the case of John's planet. All planets have consorts, usually a different kind of amphibian or reptile for each. Why amphibians or reptiles? Didn't I cover this already in another book note? Oh. You don't remember either? Well, guess we're in the same boat then. (Consorts have very short life spans, which is the joke here.) And a parcel pyxis is like a pipe mailbox they throw shit in to send places. They have a whole pipe-based civilization, but the pipes are all clogged with oil, and... You know, I did a much better job with this worldbuilding stuff by letting you understand it all in the game through exploration and inference. Too bad you're not playing it now, so you get remedial lore for boneheads down here.\n\n >29: This salamander laments the desecration of a glorious village frog idol. (Frogs are sacred. This fact will be as important as it is frequently repeated.) He talks about the underling swarm dedicated to destroying and oiling up such idols as a \"recent\" event, as if this village has existed for hundreds of years and only now have the underlings emerged to wreak mischief. This is in keeping with the strange paradox of planets in the Medium: the fact that they were just created instantly through booting up the game, and yet have always existed with entire smorgasbords of ready-made lore and quests for the players to engage with.\n\n >36: Here this sassy salamander alludes to an alliance that John's denizen seems to have formed with the agents of Derse. Those are the \"terrible guys\" who commissioned the underlings. The denizens aren't really the bad guys of this game. They're more like ornery yet neutral gods of these planets, who can help or harm depending on the circumstances. Derse agents are the formal bad guys, whose designated role is to obstruct the progress of the heroes, vandalize frog statues, antagonize frog enthusiasts, and dislike frogs in general.\n\n >37/38/40: Are you thrilled about sifting through layers of worldbuilding as conveyed through the expository bubblings of enthusiastic amphibians? Then this is the page for you. It's a pretty straightforward outline of John's formal quest on this planet. Wake the monster, kill the monster. Clean the pipes, release the Breeze. The Breeze clears the clouds, the fireflies go free. That's the goal. What does it all MEAN? That is for YOU, the reader, to boggle over, forever. It's worth nothing that when John actually gets around to doing all this, the meaning of completing this quest and the thing that it actually accomplishes are radically different than what the present stakes of the story are understood to be at this point. There is, throughout this tale, an ever-present tension between the hero's quest as presented at face value and the hero's True Quest—the mysterious journey overlaying and superseding the shallow journey described by consorts, sprites, et al—which the kids must come to grips with.\n\n >41/43: This is a pretty good procession of salamanders talking about important stuff, which perhaps makes you think it's all leading up to an encounter with some sort of regal presence in the village. Perhaps a tribal leader. But no, it's just this fool, farming all these goddamn mushrooms. The Mushroom Farmer is just notable enough of a salamander to be known to fandom as the Mushroom Farmer, and would probably be credited that way in the end credits if this were a movie. Same goes for the fellow below wearing the hat. He's known as Crumplehat. Trust me on this.\n\n >45: See? I told you his name was Crumplehat. Maybe try to fucking believe me next time I tell you stuff.\n\n >51: There are two reasons why John can only say no to this offer. First, I would have had to program an alternate path where he gives up the suit, as well as change the sprite to reflect that, and permanently introduce a fork in the story where John either sells the suit or doesn't. The second reason is it's just a straight-up dogshit offer. Giving someone a boondollar for something is like offering them a penny you found in the toilet.\n\n >58: Salamanders are pretty good at trolling, actually. So are lots of figures in Homestuck. Like John's nanna, his dad, John himself, all his friends, and also all the characters who are literally called trolls. I guess there are a lot of characters who like to troll each other because that is my forte, you could say, as a storyteller? This could also explain why characters who are actual trolls entered the story. They simply manifested as an extension of the story's nature.\n\n >65: Oh Christ, the Secret Wizard. I forgot about him. Yeah, him too. He's also a really big-deal salamander. (Just joking, he's actually a small deal.) He's a simple man. All he really wants you to do is behold his robes. That's it.\n\n >67: John's bedsheet will show up again later as well. It makes quite a trip through the story, actually, and appears in a surprising number of panels. Specifically, every single panel that WV appears in. Surprised? No? Oh. Well, let's just say you are, and move on. (Okay, wait, before we move on I should clarify something. WV's shroud is actually the dream version of John's bedsheet. The Secret Wizard just keeps this oily, shitty one forever, and then starts some sort of cult. Okay, NOW we can move on.)\n\n >70-72: So in other words, their entire mail system revolves around putting shit in the pipes, having it sent to completely random places, and whoever gets it gets it. This sounds pretty stupid, but I guess it's part of their religion or something. So you have to respect it.\n\n >78-84: When you're playing through this game, I guess one of the more low-key, gradually unfolding jokes is how it slowly becomes apparent that all the garbage from John's house that he carelessly launched out windows and fumbled over cliffs ended up down here to be scavenged by a bunch of enterprising salamanders who try to pawn all the items back on him. Or just keep them as incredible new accessories.\n\n >81: Five million boonies really isn't all that much, huh.\n\n >84: I'm glad we dedicated an entire page to the choice John makes in refusing to buy back his own shitty clown statue from this guy.\n \n Look. This is my ART, people. It needs room to BREATH.\n\n >87/88: Maybe one of the strangest traits of salamanders is how acerbically self-deprecating they are. Maybe they just hate themselves? They'd be far from the only ones in this tale. Also, here's a nice, snap game-design thing I thought of on the fly, when this game was being \"developed\" over a span of literally about forty-eight hours. Just put a damn bubble with a telescope in it hovering at exactly the place where the player needs to use the scope. That way, they use the scope, and they don't NOT use the scope. So you can see what's in the scope, over there. Incredible.\n\n >90-93: Here's what's in the scope: a view of John's house up on a tall rock-spire plateau, way off in the distance. This view gives you a sense of how far John traveled by going through his gate, the relative proximity of his house, and the fact that the house is inaccessible for a while at least. It also reveals a little more about gate logic and the distances they can send you, and helps you start to imagine hopping all around this world via gates to complete your quest. Oh, and I guess this is kind of a cool shot? Sure.\n\n >94-100: And here Nanna basically explains some stuff I just explained on the previous page. The point, obviously, is to browbeat you with explanations of Sburb game logic fundamentals until you start crying. Here's another thing I guess I haven't mentioned yet: walking through this game gives you a pretty good appreciation of the variety of imps, now that there's been another pre-entry prototyping. Remember Rose entering the game just as John goes through his gate? Now we get to observe all these imps in princess gear, or with tentacles, or cat parts, or some permutation of all three.\n\n >100: And once again Nanna steals my thunder by explaining a thing I just explained. Damn it, Nanna. I feel your pain, John. She's absolutely brutal.\n\n >107: More sass from one of these bastards. I feel like I'm getting fucking roasted every time they open their mouths. I'd look up at the sky and ask \"Why, God?\" But it's not that mysterious. I'm getting roasted by my past self and his snarkyass writing. If he wasn't trapped back in 2010 or so, I'd ask him why he wrote these damn lizards to be a bunch of wiseasses. \"That's just all I know,\" he would probably say. Yeah, I feel you man. I mean, don't get me wrong, they're funny as hell. But, why? I don't... Oh, never mind. Now I sound like a person who is insane. I'll try to do better.\n\n >111: Oh, here's the end of the game. That game was a single panel of Homestuck. And here we are, on...page 30? Thirty pages' worth of annotations just to cover the first panel of Act 4. I think I need to lie down."

So I would start messing around and pushing the stylistic boundaries a little, especially where I felt like it could save time and create a striking look. Often I played with silhouettes, which had little or no linework to waste time on. I could just quickly block in a few key shapes with solid colors, and compensate for the over-simplicity by using some snappy color choices, like those bright orange lighting effects. Throw in a few simple details—like a tie, gloves, and a few basic tree shapes back there—and you've got yourself a panel. This probably took me...ten or fifteen minutes?

It's easy to take trolls for granted as almost the center of the story when you already know about them and have been exposed to them before even reading HS. But man, when this was all just emerging for the first time, through fast and loose storytelling methods, this was Hot Fucking Stuff, let me tell you. People were psyched.\n\nBy saying \"authored by the constellations,\" I really wonder if Rose, clever person that she is, already picked up on the fact that the twelve losers in her trollslum are zodiac-themed? I know a bunch of readers picked up on it from just a few of the troll handles. Seeing all twelve handles at once makes the theme pretty obvious, but only seeing a few at a time takes a bit of deductive reasoning. It's not instantly evident that \"gallowsCalibrator\" could be referencing the mechanics of a scale, or that gallows are associated with harsh justice. Or even \"adiosToreador.\" You had to think, like, hmm... Oh, I see, bullfighting. Something about a bull... Oh, I get it now—scales, bulls, Libra, Taurus, twelve characters, it's the damn zodiac.

Thank god it's being conveyed through leet speak in all caps.\n\nTerezi was the only one who went about this in a fairly sensible way. I guess once Vriska got around to her trolling stunts, she was pretty logical and effective about it too. It's just too bad her actual goals were destructive, vainglorious, and kind of stupid.

Revealing what happened and how it happened, and the circumstances under which these facts are revealed, is the point the narrative is now marching toward. I had been stitching all this together in a fast-and-loose ad hoc manner, but at this point I felt like I had to start making some pacing adjustments to keep things more interesting.

What happened to...the first four?\n\nYou wouldn't guess it just going by the scenery, but LOHAC is the bustling financial capital of the Medium. There is a thriving stock exchange here, run by energetic, greedy lizards.\n\nThis animation was pretty slick at the time. Lots of action, cool music. Neat time tricks by Dave. It's an absolutely massive time skip that left everyone overwhelmed by its implications. Dave has already been here for months, battling monsters, hopping around gears. He's made a stylish new suit too, I guess to foster a certain Secret Time Agent chic. He's like the James Bond of horsing around with weaponized time travel, is the message being conveyed here.\n\nJust as the monsters on LOWAS and LOLAR have oil and chalk themes, these ones on LOHAC are amber-themed and yield grist accordingly. I touched on this a while back, but the \"planetary pollutant\" in a world full of clockwork would be a substance that could gum up the clockwork and make it tick slowly or grind to a halt. That would be a sticky, hardening substance like amber. The quest here on this planet, if done by the book, would involve clearing the land of its sticky pollutants so the gears could tick freely, which probably would wake up the denizen, and so on and so on...\n\nBut here's the first glimpse of why so often in this story the by-the-book quest falls into the background as something trivial, like a sidebar of mythos-color that's mainly of academic interest and not plot importance. It's because there's always bigger fish to fry. Something more imminently concerning or threatening, like having to survive for months in this hellhole while two of your friends are dead.\n\nHe did it. He prototyped the crowsprite with Cal. He knew it was a bad idea. But he did it anyway. The cursed journey of Davesprite begins with one unspeakable folly. So tragic.\n\nSay what you will about Calsprite. He's a formidable combatant. That huge puppet-ass attack? Absolutely devastating.\n\nThis sword concept is pretty cool. Caledscratch, as the weapon is named, is a broken sword, which Dave can wield thanks to his ½bladekind specibus. But it has a built-in time travel mechanism that allows it to cycle through previous states in its history, including back to a period of time when it was not yet broken. So it can extend and contract at Dave's will. A bit like a lightsaber, maybe? If you could turn on a lightsaber only halfway, I guess.\n\nDave is doing all these cool time-attack tricks. Hopping forward and backward in time, but only by a little to keep the maneuvers simple. Each time he does, he's creating a little stable time loop he has to account for. Good practice for a Knight of Time.\n\nStarting now, Dave gets into the habit of casually encountering himself a lot. It's kind of his thing. Some kind of charactery thing about his character that he has to deal with, think about, and learn from. What? Referring to it as a charactery thing about him isn't highbrow enough for you? Why don't you go back to book school for lame nerds, you dork.\n\nHe made some TURNTABLES offscreen over the last few months. They let him time travel. I'm not sure what he used to make them, other than his record players from home. Looks like some sort of mystical gear component he probably plundered from the local industrial ruins. He probably went on a lot of exciting but lonely adventures on this planet we'll never get to see or hear about.\n\nThose block-type grists are sulphur. I wonder how many huge sulphur cubes have fallen into the lava over the course of his Knight of Time berserker fits? They're kind of like giant, stinky bouillon cubes falling into a huge vat of boiling broth. It probably absolutely reeks on LOHAC when Dave goes on a rampage.\n\nRight about now, the Ruby Giclops is wondering where it all went wrong in his life. It was probably when he, for some inexplicable reason, decided to swim through an ocean of lava to go mess with this boy in a suit going nuts with a sword.\n\nYou can tell Dave is probably overloaded with grist he doesn't particularly need by now. He carves up that giclops, and it starts raining huge rubies everywhere. But he doesn't seem to care at all about harvesting them. Instead, he takes a moment to yell at his puppet."

Which sounds like a funny thing for me to say—and it is—but it's also not that remarkable, since at any given moment Homestuck is full of surrogates for various factions of the readership. Basically any character who is viewing the actions of other characters on a screen can be seen as a consumer of that story through some form of in-canon digital media. Whether they type in character commands like the exiles, or use Trollian to skip around the \"archive\" in a nonlinear way like the trolls do, for the sake of \"adventure analysis\" or to heap scorn on those involved, every narrative-viewing character is temporarily filling the role of the Homestuck reader from a certain angle. Later, cherubs become the ultimate distillation of the idea.\n\nThere's something kind of eerie about these stable time loops when it comes to the absurd, bitchy conversations the characters have with each other. There is literally no discernible origin to this prank John is playing. It's pasted to him from the future, he thinks it's a great prank, and he decides to play the prank in the future because of it, exactly as typed here. And yet, the whole exchange appears to be perfectly in character and in full alignment with their personalities. So entire exchanges between two individuals can be totally without origin, yet still sound exactly like them. This opens up a whole bunch of creepy possibilities. Ghosts or afterimages of their personalities seemingly can emerge from pure void in a convincing way, like bodiless simulacra. Echoing time loop mimic-wraiths, intruding on their conversations. All right, that's enough creepypasta for one night. Pleasant dreams!\n\nOne of the most passive-aggressive things the trolls do is saying stuff like \"YOUR STRANGE HUMAN TEAR DUCTS,\" as if the concept of crying is foreign to them, and really, as if they aren't all bawling their asses off constantly like a bunch of shitty babies.\n\nIf I were really, really on the ball here this far in advance of crafting certain points of troll lore, instead of calling her \"YOUR DUMB GRANDMA,\" I might have said \"YOUR DUMB RESURRECTED ANCESTOR\" instead. That's surely how Karkat would have parsed the concept of a human's dead grandmother he'd never met before. There was no such thing as troll ancestors at the point when I was writing this, though. Even the hemospectrum concept hadn't been fleshed out yet. Sorry, nerds.\n\nFrom my perspective, the great thing about this stupid backwards conversation was that any time someone wanted to know the answer to an obvious question, like \"What's the point of the game?\", and I didn't think it was time to reveal that info yet, I could just have this jerk say \"I ALREADY TOLD YOU THAT\" and justifiably be reluctant to repeat himself. But he would indulge in other details of lesser importance, like the material here about the Veil. He hasn't mentioned that yet, so he can take some time to cover it now. It's a totally organic and logical way of concealing critical story information so that it flows in an order of least critical to most critical."

What an absurd amount of content I produced in that year, especially when you consider the animation stuff. Good thing I slowed down after that, right? No, I kept doing the exact same thing for the next several years. Yikes, sounds bad... So about this animation. I think this one marks the start of Homestuck's trend thereafter of dropping exceptionally violent, high-octane, game-changing animations out of nowhere. There are so many like this from here on, right up to the end of Act 5. Only then does the number sort of taper off. But from this point on I just sorta started shoveling more and more red meat into the story's maw. This stretch is where I was starting to get a feel for this type of sensationalistic storytelling content as something I'd later code (mostly for my own internal purposes) as \"meat,\" in the meat/candy binary of storycraft theory. I really shouldn't talk about this yet, though. It's too soon.\n\n0:14 - Karkat was just talking about the Veil, a meteor belt just outside the planets, and now we're seeing it as we pull further back from Skaia all the way to Derse. This sequence provides a visual perspective on the full cosmology of the session, which we haven't had until now.\n\n0:35 - Jack is so pissed at his queen. These two getting testy with each other is built into their relationship across all sessions. No matter what the specific situation, she's probably always finding ways to needle him. Dress code, paperwork, it doesn't matter. This is programmed into them as game constructs to guarantee that there will always be friction between them, which allows for more interesting variations in how any given game of Sburb can play out. There's always a powder keg of mutiny waiting to go off, and depending on the actions of the heroes, there are many, many ways this can play out over a session. We see one way right here, in this animation, and another in the troll session, with totally different results. But what remains constant is Jack's inclination to betray his queen.\n\n0:58 - Here's the first time we see the queen after the crow/sword prototyping. She's now got a sword through the chest and wings, in addition to the other nonsense. The schematics for the final villain (only of this session, mind you) are coming closer to completion.\n\n1:04 - It looks like the queen catches Jack...spying on her? He's lustily spying on her as she approaches his office in order to force him to wear a demeaning garment, probably also in a lusty manner. These two. SMH.\n\n1:05 - Wearing six pink garters on each tentacle really is one of the most risqué fashion choices imaginable.\n\n1:16 - Even though it lasts only about a second or two, this dress-up montage is kind of incredible when you think about what it implies. They're actually spending...hours, maybe?...trying out different clothes that Jack might like better. Think of what this means, and of all the actual conversations that have to take place between them to facilitate this. It shows the queen is actually willing to exercise some lenience and let Jack's taste determine the garb so long as it's sufficiently clown-princess themed. Jack also displays a surprising degree of patience in trying on so many variations. It also suggests that somewhere the queen has an entire wardrobe of this stuff ready to go.\n\nContinuing from the previous note, this scene also puts into context how unreasonable Jack's final tantrum is. He just finally SNAPS! But Jack, if you were going to fly into a murderous rage over this kinky little dress-up game, why did you bother putting up with it for so long in the first place?\n\n1:28 - This brief interlude in the animation shows that Rose's dream self has finally woken up, due to her future doomed self going to sleep and \"ceasing to exist.\" She has inherited some hazy memories from that version of her self, or if not all her memories per se, at least some of her perceptual faculty. Now she can see the graffiti she wrote on her walls, which previously was invisible to her due to some psychological block.\n\n1:37 - This is the secret Jaspers once whispered to her, which was simply, \"Meow.\" This word didn't really tell Rose's younger self anything informative so much as it unlocked information already in her brain, which was an important genetic sequence. She uses the letters of MEOW in place of the usual letters for genetic codes, GCAT. This gene sequence is an important part of the full code that's later used to genetically engineer.....(drumroll).....an omnipotent dog.\n\n1:41 - Here we also take a peek at what the guardians are up to. Looks like they're wandering the planets, being generally badass. Nice to know. A lot of times the songs I was animating around were a little long. So if the key purpose of an animation, like \"Jack usurps queen in murderous fit,\" wasn't quite enough material to fit the length of the song, I would look for little ways of padding out the action like this.\n\n1:49 - The guardians are all very strong and able fighters. We already knew that, but it's good to have it reaffirmed sometimes. I don't know what the hell is up with that lava octopus wearing a princess hat. That's the only time we see anything like that. I liked to promote the impression that the underling population is actually really diverse. Maybe you could play ten sessions of Sburb and never really catalogue them all. Also, this makes me wonder if that princess hat is fireproof, or if the octopus just takes great care to never fully submerge in the lava?\n\n1:57 - Jack, just use your safe word. There is absolutely no reason to reach for the bunny box and murder this sexy queen.\n\n2:04 - Goddamn it. What did I just say.\n\nOkay, I keep referring to the fact that there is a lethal bunny in that box, which really is completely ruining the mystery of it. I am FUCKING sorry. At this point, even though it's clear that whatever Jade and her pen pal put in that box possesses extreme destructive power, we still have no idea what it is. It's an ongoing mystery, right up until we finally see what's inside, when the culmination of this fairly long-running gag reveals it's the same damn bunny at different stages of its history inside every birthday box. Just thought I'd note that all here, that we still don't know what's in the box, but it's not worth getting hung up on because something much more dramatic is happening... Look!\n\n2:27 - Jack's mutiny, along with his ridiculous transformation, is complete. What a devil's bargain he just struck. In order to claim supreme power, he must agree to have the absurd attire he so vehemently resisted actually become physically inseparable from himself. Yet the choice he has made is clear. Power prevails over dignity. That said, being forced to look like a clown in exchange for this boon isn't exactly going to keep him in a good mood.\n\n2:33 - Because this animation went up on 4/13, it almost formally locked Homestuck into Magic Date Syndrome thereafter. There were always huge expectations revolving around what might occur on some key date in HS numerical lore—which, to be fair, was always being fueled by the fact that I kept putting significant moments on those key dates. For example, something significant happened on just about every 4/13 after this, right up until the final page, which was posted on 4/13 of Year Seven."

AH, the character, as the cartoon avatar for The Creator, has a sort of arc, I guess you could call it. There are many facets to the psychological profile of the creative individual. One of them is this preposterously megalomaniacal, self-absorbed, power-drunk persona which, arguably, is often the motivating force behind an individual's desire to create certain things in the first place. A being supremely enamored of art's ability to let them conjure anything out of thin air, manipulate people's emotions in any direction on a whim, and to revel in this whole process as some sort of innate celebration of their ingenuity. In this grand farce called Homestuck, we introduce the AH author-god in this way to set him on a path to reveal different qualities of the creative psyche. More to the point, he is set upon a long-term trajectory from being the supreme goofball-savant in absolute command of his craft to gradually becoming a victim of his creation, as much at the mercy of the forces it unleashes as he was the original architect of their unleashing."

They're huge, planet-hopping schemes requiring hella teamwork. Also, here we begin the chronicles of Real Dave vs. Bird Dave, and what the meaning of someone's \"real self\" even is. It's a sore subject, and John is routinely insensitive about it to his bro. John probably flashes a lot of \"real self privilege\" throughout the story because he's one of the only characters who remains the original version of himself all the way until the end.

But of course, this all hinges on the fact that Kanaya can't see who she's talking to yet, for some reason...

It's impressive that there's such a good explanation to circumvent the crisis in logic that could have otherwise been. It's also interesting that Kanaya knows a few things about the \"Rose Human.\" It invites all kinds of questions. Who talked up Rose to her? Was it Karkat?

          "content": "[S] WV?: Rise up is another big, splashy, game-changing animation. We get a megadose of worldbuilding when it comes to the Battlefield, which has been a fairly mysterious, neglected cosmological feature up until now. It evolves to become more complex with each player entry, and only begins resembling a planet on the third change. When it reaches planet form, that's when it finally serves as a viable stage for a major, global war between the two kingdoms. And remember that time is screwy for these game-construct settings. Once they come into being, it's as if they've always been. In other words, when the Battlefield turns into a planet, suddenly it's as if it has always been a planet and a war has been raging there for years.\n\n0:26 - It's very fortunate for the peasants that their planet-sized chessboard is arable.\n\n0:43 - In this big chess analogy, these guys are pawns, I guess. The analogy must be pretty loose though, because it doesn't seem like any of them are respecting the grid they're marching over at all.\n\n0:49 - Yeah, I... I'm going to have to admit, this is where the chess analogy breaks down completely. This is just fucking Star Wars now.\n\n0:52 - The big rook freak there is a brief glimpse of the cruelty and horrors of genetic engineering for the purposes of royal warfare.\n\n0:59 - WV began life as a simple farmer. It's a small enough detail that I don't actually remember if he was a defector from the Derse army who started to farm, or if he began that way because for some reason the kingdom also supplies a stock of peasants to farm the land while a battle rages on. Either way, he's an extremely war-weary guy, and not happy at all that the nice, tall grass he was farming just burned down.\n\n1:05 - The incineration of WV's can-themed farm is what triggers his hatred of kings and their warmongering tyranny. We knew he hated kings, and now we know why he hates kings. You can check this off your list now.\n\n1:09 - Here's our first glimpse of a king. His scepter, rather than a magic ring, is what grants him the power of the prototypings. It also makes him huge, and thus a formidable opponent, and is why he's basically the final boss of any Sburb session, assuming the game goes how it's supposed to. Just like chess, obviously: you kill the king and you win.\n\n1:12 - The scepter is a pretty special object. Aside from granting powers and size, it has Skaia itself sitting atop it. Not a mock Skaia, as an ornament, but the real Skaia, as a smaller instantiation of itself, currently contained within itself as a recursive construct. Flying into the Skaia on the scepter is exactly the same as flying into Skaia in the center of the Medium. You could then travel down to the Battlefield, find the king, and fly into Skaia all over again. But if you leave Skaia, you'd never fly out of the scepter. You'd always just fly out of Skaia. Got it? Imagine him using this as a weapon in the final battle. He swats one member of your party with it, and suddenly they find themselves all the way at the edge of Skaia, and they have to fly down to the Battlefield to rejoin the battle, wasting valuable time. It's a nasty end-boss move that can disrupt your tactics.\n\n1:24 - Two things are brewing here. WV is organizing his mutiny by recruiting disaffected troops from both sides. Meanwhile, Jack is flying overhead, planning his massacre by sizing up all of WV's troops for a nice murder spree.\n\n1:29 - Racism is over.\n\n1:33 - This is all part of the White Queen's gambit. Hand off the ring and scepter to PM, so she can keep them safe, while WQ and WK get out of Dodge and meet on post-apocalyptic Earth to colonize it. She realizes this session is hopeless, and there's nothing much else to do but escape, start a new civilization, and blow up all the bridges between Earth and the session. It almost works!\n\n1:38 - It's of some interest to note that PM is holding the scepter. Which means that wielding it, unlike wearing the ring, does not grant powers to just any carapacian. The scepter apparently only works its magic on kings. As Jack proves later though, you can still wield the scepter and utilize certain powers it has, like initiating the Reckoning.\n\n1:42 - Sburb as an infinitely complex game of Silly Chess means it has a few loose parallels with the rules of chess. In chess, the king, while essential to keep alive, is a very weak piece. The scepter-bearing kings here obviously are very strong, so that's a departure. But one similarity is of a tactical nature. The kings here are still these slow, lumbering things of very limited tactical value. They stay on the Battlefield, don't cover a lot of ground, and are kind of sitting ducks when someone nasty like Jack flies along. Whereas queens have far greater tactical maneuverability. They generally stay on Derse, but can really go anywhere and can do a lot of damage, armed with their very powerful rings. But again, as in chess, they generally stay put for a while and are only deployed once strategy demands it.\n\n1:52 - It's probably considered bad form by just about any other carapacian to think about destroying a king's scepter. That's not how a cleanly fought war is supposed to go. But Jack is designed to be a cheater.\n\n1:55 - I wonder if WV is second-guessing why he was ever even mad at this guy. He looks like he could be a nice buddy, if they decided to bury the hatchet right here. Too bad it will be a moot point soon.\n\n1:57 - Featured above: one of the worst fistbump malfunctions of all time.\n\n1:58 - What would have happened if Jack hadn't intervened here? Would WV's insurrection have succeeded? There isn't much reason to believe WV's army would have defeated a giant prototyped king, so most likely Jack just saved WV's life. Sburb includes a lot of possibilities for making things interesting outside of its usual programmed path, which probably includes potential for little pawn guy mutinies like this now and then. But it wouldn't be much of a game if a bunch of pawns could take down the final boss before you ever meet him. The possibility of a Jack mutiny being successful, in which case he simply replaces the final boss, is a much more interesting way for the game to mix things up.\n\n2:06 - I really have no idea how Jack crammed that crown on his head, over his jester prongs. Are those like...floppy? Did he bunch all the prongs together first, and feed them into the hat, before yanking it down for them to rip through the fabric? He also only has one arm to accomplish all this. It seems awkward. Whatever he did, WV sure wasn't thrilled about the spectacle.\n\n2:10 - Then this scepter just stays here until [S] Descend. I can't for the life of me remember how it actually gets from this location to being in Jack's possession. Hang on while I flip ahead to the end of the book. Oh okay, it's CD. He picks it up and gives it to Jack. Of course he does. What a little scamp."

Often I had to come up with creative styles for my OCs, like their drawing style or handwriting style, which could be a challenge, and occasionally I had to come up with a creative writing style that would befit a character's personality. The best examples of that are Rose's and Roxy's respective wizard fics, which, while similar in subject matter, are worlds apart in style and humor.

Karkat should recognize the similarity that Christmas has to his beloved holiday, while marveling at how stupid it is that humans lug a tree into their house instead of doing the wholesome thing, which is obviously to bring home a giant turd.\n\nKarkat helpfully removes all doubt that these babies grow up to be our heroes, and that they aren't just some copies John made. When telling a complicated story, generally it's a good idea to absolutely corner the reader into understanding exactly what is and isn't happening. And even then, they often still don't understand. You can lead a horse to water, etc., etc. Paradox clones are just standard clones, except that, paradoxically, the DNA comes from the very person they eventually grow up to be. So where did the DNA come from in the first place? It somehow spontaneously generated itself in paradox space, I guess. Or was \"fundamental\" to it in some unfathomable way. Just like the self-originating bullshit all these kids bicker at each other about in these stable time loop conversations they're having.\n\nThe Ultimate Riddle is one of those things the exact definition of which is kind of a moving target throughout the story, due to its mysterious—you could say, riddle-like—nature. Kind of like the way the Mirthful Messiahs can refer to different \"mirthful\" pairs of people, depending on at what point in the story the idea is discussed.\n\nOf course Karkat is the John of the group. He's the main guy, for one thing, so duh. Second, he's a \"geneticist,\" where John is a \"biologist.\" The \"carcino\" suggests his influence in the process was cancerous or defective in some way, except that's more of a \"karkat's bad self-esteem\" thing than anything actually supported by the text. Anyway, all I really want to do is take a moment to appreciate Karkat's nod to the absurd speeding ticket system in Sburb that I have been low-key roasting myself over throughout much of this commentary."

I think you will agree this is a really, really interesting train of thought. Who is Superman the Trickster Mode version of? Is Superman actually Trickster Batman? It kind of makes sense. Superman flies around, is ridiculously overpowered, solves problems without much effort, and has kind of a saccharine attitude about justice and all compared to Batman.

With these swift narrative karate chops, one after another, this act answers so many of the questions that have been dangling out there for a long time now.

But now knowing they both got there as part of a mutiny plot to assist the trolls adds some texture to their backstory, and explains why Slick and Snowman still have this contentious thing going on.\n\nI actually have strong doubts that John liked to play Crash Bandicoot.

A cumulative celebration, if you will, of Homestuck's whimsical essence and its uncompromising spirit of absurdity. Now, here in this book, examining the frames will be more of a somber, meditative practice. I invite you to quietly behold Nic Cage's face for several minutes. Reflect on his visage the way one shows reverence for a religious icon during moments of silence in a church. You will come to understand that this sequence doesn't need funny music at all, and your appreciation of the content will be all the richer for it.\n\nThis does admirably explain how Rose and Jade got these bunnies as their Birth Objects. It wasn't their own attraction to the bunnies, which wouldn't have made a lot of sense. It was John's attraction to the idea of performing this stupid skit at a highly inappropriate moment, which resulted in them being shipped off to Earth with a couple of ratty bunnies, thus setting the stage for them to grow up and regift the bunnies back to John in the first place.\n\nThe official Con Air bunny I own is not the [real one Nic Cage is holding]. That's the ruined one at the end of the movie. I don't know where that one is, or frankly, if it even survived the shoot. The one in my possession is the bunny still in its original package, which Nic Cage buys for his daughter at the beginning of the movie. I'm just assuming that at some point in the future, I will have to travel back in time and give Cage the bunny for him to use in the film in the first place.\n\nThe skit is essentially complete once Rose gets the bunny. But Jade gets one too, as kind of an afterthought. John does have another bunny to spare, so why not? That way these three young ladies all go home with something nice. Jane, however, gets fuck all, since she's offscreen at the moment, having decided to crawl into a man's filthy hat.\n\nKarkat is being melodramatic and pretending not to enjoy every minute of this spectacle. We don't know it yet, or have the context for understanding what it means, but at this moment he has a hate crush on John. It was hate at first sight. Every morsel of conversation we have read between these two has been driven by these feelings. What he is doing here now, bonking his own head, is nothing more than an act of powerful sexual frustration.\n\nThe scribbled sequence above is misleading. By the time the plane crashes into the giant guitar in Vegas, the sports car it was keeping in tow had long since been severed. Also, there's another floating arm. What a great place to sneak an arm in. Generally when I was retconning arms into the story, the more surreal and incomprehensible a location was for John's arm to show up, the better. Not only did this moment not even take place inside the canon of the comic, it didn't even take place in the canon of the movie. It truly happened nowhere. And yet, there is his arm.\n\nThere is nothing remotely stupid about any of this.\n\nJohn, his name is Bubbles Von Salamancer now. Respect his new identity.\n\nRoxy seems to be really getting into that hug there. I think I did a tremendous job in seeding her overwhelming attraction to Egbert men here in Act 4. Stick this fact in your pipe and consider smoking it toward the end of Act 6.\n\nThere's a part in Con Air when John Malkovich holds a gun up to the bunny during a tense moment and says don't move or the bunny gets it. Or something like that. The rowdy criminals like to keep things loose and fun up there on the jail plane, as you will know if you have seen the film, which you have, at least a hundred times. Don't deny it.\n\nAt some point in this song cover, there's a guitar solo. But nobody is playing a guitar. It's just some guy making jackass noises with his mouth. So John here is working his air guitar to go along with that riff. Actually it make sense that a Hero of Breath would play an air guitar. I really do think of everything... It's incredible."

          "content": "[S] Descend is the longest animation up to this point, at about four minutes (and thirteen seconds iirc). There are a few other significant escalations of animation gravitas in this act, but then this one comes along and dunks on them all. It's a little different from previous animations which in general tend to have more of a singular focus, with a few subplots sprinkled in. This one is all over the place. It covers a lot of ground in the plot, switches between many different frames of reference, everything is explosive, and it all sort of glides from one scene to another in sync with a fairly ambitious (at the time) musical medley by Toby Fox, who titled the song \"Descend.\" So that's what I named the animation as well.\n\nThere's another animation in HS that fits the previous description but is much longer. In a way, Descend is like Cascade Lite. Or Cascade is Descend Heavy. Anyway, as with almost all HS animations, the song existed well before I ever started animating and usually informed the ideas I would have for it, including how all the action was paced and arranged. So the fact that this particular song was so eclectic, jumping all over the place a lot more than other songs tended to, led to this sort of action-collage feel to the way it plays out. Suddenly we're here, then we're over there, then whoops something blows up, and we're back over here, and now there's...wait, what? Squiddles?? Oh never mind, back to some other important stuff. It's a wild way to end a wild act, but as usual when it comes to anything ambitious and unprecedented in HS, it just turns out to be a warm-up for even crazier things down the road.\n\n0:07 - We finally rewind so we can see the famous \"embarrassing entry incident\" with Dave. Was it absolutely necessary to do this? No, I guess not. It probably would have felt like a strange missing chunk of the story, though. I think what this segment primarily accomplishes is demonstrating the fact that Bro is capable of chopping a meteor in half with his sword. That's quite a Big Fact.\n\n0:15 - So the \"incident\" really is just that Dave gets pecked on the head and falls. Not all that embarrassing, honestly. Dave has been blowing this out of proportion, as one might guess. This moment does give us another example of the fact that not all contact with a sprite will result in prototyping. Often minor points of brief or light contact with the sprite won't do it. Like passing your hand quickly over a candle before it burns, an analogy I may have used before.\n\n0:20 - It seems absolutely crazy that Bro's standing on a meteor and riding it down to Earth. Until you realize (later in this very animation) that they all came down to Earth that way as infants. So it's second nature to them in a way, and they seem inoculated to the ill effects of riding a flaming meteor, for reasons that defy any remotely defensible explanation grounded in even the most desperate feats of authorial asspull logic. So I will not offer any to you at this time. But do not take this as an admission that I COULDN'T. I'm just kinda busy, that's all.\n\n0:30 - Don't worry everybody, Bro is here to save you all. By...splitting the meteor in two, so there will be two devastating impact sites instead of one. But the important thing is, this buys Dave a few extra seconds. Also, I don't think we see the egg hatch here? It hatches in the animation. Basically the idea was, there was never anything for Dave to do. He just had to wait for the egg to hatch in a warm environment when it was good and ready, under stressful circumstances. A simple test of patience.\n\n0:38 - I wonder how Bro's board knows what to do. Some sort of AI embedded in it? That explanation wouldn't be totally baseless. He did program a lot of chat room bots, lusty for puppets.\n\n0:44 - SMASH CUT to Dave where we left him, being guided by Terezi to enter his first gate. Where will it take him? Somewhere on LOHAC, where his unconscionable dollarcrimes may begin.\n\n0:50 - Mom and Dad, armed to the teeth with their weapons of choice, proceed to Skaia for reasons unknown. I think...maybe they just got married?? We didn't see what happened, but they might have gotten married, guys, just a head's up. So this is their honeymoon destination. A romantic getaway to the Battlefield. Hope nothing goes wrong!\n\n1:00 - Jack just wants the peasants to kiss his ring. Is that too much to ask? Or his sword. With their torsos. Actually that's probably what he wants. Forget the thing I said about kissing his ring. He'll kill you if you try to do that.\n\n1:03 - Here's some different art styles. Starting with the Battlefield scene where Jack kills the king, I got pretty fast and loose with the art styles because I was trying out the idea of an \"art team\" for these longer animations. A few people chipping in art assets, no matter how different or crazy the styles get, just to shorten the amount of time needed to make more ambitious pieces like this. [S] Descend only took about a week, which is a stupidly short period of time to make and release content like this. I was always looking for shortcuts to keep the pipeline SPITTING FIRE, and one idea was to start using contributions from others no matter what the style. Getting a group to stay \"on model,\" editing, and retouching stuff eats up too much time. I said what was needed, people made stuff, I tweaked it a little in Photoshop, and slapped it in there. Instant animation studio.\n\n1:12 - Meanwhile, WV...heroically shuffles to the back of the crowd while his loyal rebels get slaughtered? What is he doing?? Shaking my damn head over here.\n\nKarkat once said Jack stabs you to say hello. I guess this is his formal mass-greeting ritual. Everyone bleeding on the floor should feel honored.\n\n1:13 - Oh, I see how it is, WV. You scurry to the back of the crowd, wait until Jack kills everyone, run forward again and pretend you were there all along, and now you're just SHOCKED that he did this. SHOCKED, you say! Actually, a less cowardly explanation might be something like this: Sburb seems to designate certain figures like him as \"special\" pawns, who are reserved for doing important things later, whatever they might turn out to be. Like being an exile or something. Since Jack and other agents are constructs too, maybe they can \"smell\" special pieces and avoid killing them? Maybe that's why HB only punched PM instead of eating her head. If certain constructs are built in certain ways to mix things up and keep the game's \"plot\" interesting, it doesn't really serve that purpose if they indiscriminately kill each other off before they've had a chance to do whatever curveball things they were built to do.\n\n1:16 - We don't know it yet, but this attack is called Red Miles. It shoots miles and miles of deadly red stuff out of his ring. Just another reason the ring is powerful, which is a fact we learn right now. It helps you picture why, under ordinary circumstances, the queen would be a formidable adversary for players to defeat. That's one reason why it pays to get deeper into the political strategy of Sburb and try to stage crafty ousting operations like the trolls did. If you're a Sburb player, why would you want to mess around with shit like this?\n\n1:22 - Yeah, I don't know what the hell these things are. I guess dead is what.\n\n1:26 - We are still dealing with countdowns. Not countdowns to entry into Sburb this time, but a Reckoning countdown. Countdown-based tension will continue all the way until the end of Act 5, when a bomb called the Tumor finally blows up. After that, we chill out with the countdowns mostly. The countdowns are replaced by a lot of other stuff. Like, for instance, several dozen intermissions, and Too Much Gamzee.\n\n1:27 - There they go. This is the last time you will ever see that pony and kitten alive. Rest in pieces, dear friends.\n\n1:33 - That big Prospitian bomber is pretty cool. It does make me wonder why they decided to build conventional aircraft to mix in with all their clearly superior Star Wars space ships. You never know with these chess guys.\n\n1:36 - Jack is taken aback by the moxie of this rifle battalion. I guess I am too. I forgot there were guys with rifles? I'm just going to be the one to say what we're all thinking. These chess armies are ridiculous.\n\n1:42 - CD is always the guy who's there at the exact right time, holding the exact right thing when the boss needs it. He's loyal and reliable to a fault, if a bit simple-minded, and extremely literal in the interpretation of his orders. We see him play this role again just before Cascade, when he drops several tons of shaving cream on Jade. He really believed it was what the boss wanted him to do. But that time, it was not.\n\n1:48 - Jack is initiating the Reckoning. It's unclear why he wants to do so. When in doubt, the fact that he likes to destroy things, murder people, and cause problems will suffice for any explanation of his motives. This is the crisis Karkat was alluding to. The Black King would observe better form and would wait much longer before doing this. He'd want to allow the kids to make it much further in the game, and get close to challenging him directly before turning on the heat of an imminent meteor shower. He's programmed to be a much better sport than Jack.\n\n1:51 - The scepter \"summons\" the meteors, and they start to fly toward Skaia one by one. DD meanwhile doesn't have much time to finish his work here unless he wants to get stuck in these ruins with this dang dog and AR. That would turn into an awkward roommate situation on post-apocalyptic Earth. There probably wouldn't be enough caution tape for the two of them.\n\n1:58 - We could already infer this was going to happen when we first saw this machine locked on Halley a while ago because we are smart. Also this helps us understand why AR recognized the Bec shape carved on the pumpkin and regarded it with possibly some combination of fear and reverence. It would also not be too illogical if carapacians were programmed to recognize and respect a First Guardian, or in some cases, to go to the bother of cloning the guardian in the first place. As DD does here, and the queen does later with Doc.\n\n2:15 - Ms. Paint is ready to go. Her proximity to the queen suggests she has a prominent position in the royal hierarchy. As she very well should. Anyway, this is just a quick glimpse of the queen and her entourage evacuating, heading to Earth to rebuild civilization and preserve Prospitian culture.\n\n2:24 - Very strong smash cut. We don't need to see what he did. It's just on fucking fire. NEXT!!!!!\n\n2:39 - This proves the chain is definitely keeping Prospit's moon in orbit and isn't just for show. Which means if the chain is severed, the moon just gets launched along whatever trajectory it was headed on, like a stone launched by a slingshot. So, that's what happens. Also, it's kind of interesting how if you view Skaia as if it were a planet, and you were hovering over its surface looking at the horizon like this, all its clouds are upside down. That's because Skaia is a big ball of pure sky, and the sky is up. You aren't supposed to STAND on it, like some kind of FOOL. You look UP at it, from a place like Prospit.\n\n2:44 - Jack seems to know exactly where to go in order to find the biggest badass he can throw down with. It probably took a while to get to LOHAC, but this anime dude's ass isn't going to kick itself.\n\n2:59 - We just saw exhibitions of both these guys' power. Bro sliced a meteor in half, Jack spewed a bunch of red junk from his ring and chopped a giant chain. So we know they're heavyweights. But this is just a taste. A duel that ends in a stalemate. Round Two comes later.\n\nIt just seems Bro's main goal here isn't to duel so much as get the Scratch started. If not literally, then to leave a clue for the other kids to figure out. Because of course he can't just come out and TELL the kids, hey guys, you're screwed. You're going to need to scratch this giant record to reset things, and here's how exactly. Mysterious ninja bros don't explain stuff, it cramps their style. They mostly communicate through interpretive sword fights.\n\n3:01 - This is the Squiddles intermission. I spent some time joking about how there would be a huge Squiddles intermission, with like a forty-eight-player Squiddle Sburb session, and we would get to know each one in great detail. I threatened this more than once, I think. But in the end, this three-second clip of nonsense was probably the closest we ever got to that. Sorry, buddies, you will be fondly remembered for the useless and utterly unwanted subplot you could have starred in.\n\n3:20 - Every now and then, between the thousands and thousands of pages of sobbing teens complaining about their feelings and being basically useless, I fuck up and make one of them do something truly heroic.\n\n3:30 - Jade, this is no time to be giving your dear brother John a savage pair of purple nurples. Why don't you try waking him up instead?\n\n3:38 - Jade shows off her quarterback's arm, which appears to be capable of hurling John entirely outside the blast radius of an explosion that's about the size of the planet.\n\n3:42 - Here we catch up to this milestone moment, the mysterious incident Karkat refers to when Jade's robot blows up. Now we know its circuits overload or something because Dream Jade dies. Keep that in mind as a precedent. When Dream You dies, Robot You blows up. Jade told Karkat to contact her after this point because it's a significant, conspicuous moment that clearly delineates two different phases of her journey: the one where she's got all the answers due to being able to see cloud visions from Prospit, and the one where she doesn't know anything and is at a loss for what to do next. The future isn't her business anymore. The trolls have completely taken over that racket.\n\n3:53 - Skaia activates its defenses in response to the Reckoning. The fact that the portals send things back in time, toward Earth, is a secondary purpose. The primary purpose is just to catch meteors and protect the Battlefield, allowing the players as much time as possible to defeat the king and create the universe. But the longer the Reckoning goes on, the more meteors come, and the more Skaia struggles to defend itself with portals. Unfortunately, every meteor it successfully diverts is sent to Earth, which is another nail in its coffin. Skaia sacrifices the planet of origin so that its child (a new universe) may have a chance to be born. But it simultaneously seeds the dead planet with the potential for new life and civilization (exiles), and retroactively seeds the planet with the children who would fertilize Skaia with the new universe. This is the essence of the universal creation cycle. Sacrifice the old to make way for the new. Life rises again from the ashes of the old. Rinse and repeat. Something else to wonder: how often has Earth itself been through this process before humanity came along?\n\n4:01 - Maybe it says something about Dirk that he is easily the most contented with his particular Birth Object. He doesn't care that he's riding a meteor. He just wants to snuggle up with his new puppet dad and take a nap.\n\n4:06 - Rose starts to go a little nuts here. It might be that her partial union with her future dream self's memories has started to breed an intense hatred for this game and its cruel manifold futilities, and this one spontaneous decision to blow up her gate sets her on a path of recklessness and destruction. It's also possible she's just being a shitty teen. As a general rule in this story, never rule that out.\n\n4:08 - This is a pretty good explosion graphic/animation. You can tell I felt that way, because I reused it a bunch of times in later panels. But maybe that isn't saying much, because I reused almost everything, even bad things.\n\n4:17 - Me, from my director's chair: Okay, activate the Meteor POV camera...now! And, scene. Several moments of silence. Someone on the set begins to slow-clap. It turns out that's me. I'm doing the slow-clap.\n\nWell, that's the end of Act 1. See you next time, everybody, as we begin our journey through Act 2.\n\nJust joking, this is the end of Act 4, not Act 1. We're going forwards, not backwards, silly. Tune in next time, for Act 5, when we go way, way backwards, and meet Karkat at the beginning of his journey. It'll be great. Wait, there are still some more pages in this book?? Goddamn it.\n\n4:27 - Before we go, let's make one more note about how huge Jade's meteor is. This is the big one, the Extinction Level Event meteor. Just as the Reckoning escalates and becomes harder for Skaia to stave off the longer it goes on, the deeper we get into the meteor shower on Earth the more apocalyptic the meteors get. Note that Bec is standing there, watching, like a very good dog, and we close out on the Bec head shape. This suggests things are going to start getting very, very Bec-y. But not until after Hivebent, which, as I have warned, is a significant haul. It should be an entire book's work of content, if I am not mistaken.\n\n4:36 - More magic numbers. Seriously, don't even ask me how I pulled stuff like this off. It just worked out a lot of the time. The next magic number introduced is 612, because that's the date when Act 5 began, 6/12. There's a lot to say about that magic number, like how the group of kids are four thirteen-year-olds, and the group of trolls are twelve six-sweep-olds. Lots and lots of stuff like that, but wow, I really should consider shutting the fuck up already and save some material for the next book.\n\nDescend was a good note to end on because it spins out a lot of exciting plot threads for the next time we check in with all these guys (which, don't worry, won't be until after we slog through about 600 pages of Hivebent). Dave enters his gate, Rose blows up her gate and flies away like a lunatic to do god knows what, Jade is falling from her room which just exploded, and John is floating around in his pajamas looking dumber than usual, wondering why there's a huge flaming crater on a planet he doesn't recognize. So you can imagine why there was some grumbling from the peanut gallery when immediately after this we start lurching through the introduction of all twelve trolls for several months. Too bad for all those suckers that everybody loved the trolls, and my ludicrous pacing decisions were absolutely vindicated, as they always are.\n"

The idea originally was, I think, to check back on this walkthrough document as Rose updated it, and learn more about the game as she learns. But clearly the game is way off the rails now, so there's not much point in such a linear transcription effort. Also, she's getting moodier, edgier, and tiptoeing ever closer to full-blown grimdarkness. I think 1 Corinthians 13 put it best: \"When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child; but when I became a woman, I put away childish things, such as my prolix, ridiculously overblown GameFAQs walkthrough project.\"\n\nWe probably all agree that etching your initials with extravagant lettering into the digital canvas of your walkthrough file using *DARK MAGIC* is a pretty Teen-Dramatic thing to do.

This actually does a pretty admirable job of explaining why trans-universal internet connections are able to be relayed just about anywhere, such as between the human universe and troll universe, and between a session and a home planet. The relay servers are stationed in a continuum that supersedes all these locations. Some of them are special though, like this one. There's another special one we see later that has a flickering pool ball on it."

If we're REALLY on the ball, we're probably also wondering, \"Isn't this just young Grandpa Harley?\" The answer is yes, of course. The question then is, what does that mean? From what timeline? Why is he helping? Who's twisting his arm? (It's Calliope.) And what, ultimately, is the point of shoving all this deadly stuff in this box and mailing it through time and space anyway?

Homestuck, as I will probably keep saying, isn't just a story, it's the confining reality for these kids. The \"Homestuck = Life\" model of interpretation is often clarifying. The story itself is indistinguishable from the alienating, hostile realm the kids are attempting to grow up in.

We have to make a lot of those leaps ourselves, though.

Either that, or Aradia is lying to Sollux about why there needs to be two teams. It's not to maximize chances of success, since the game doesn't even recognize \"teams\" anyway. There was always just one big team. They only needed to think there were two, for the purpose of setting up the initial conditions of the session the way they did.

They all start out as kind of shitty ideas that then receive elaboration and actual character development, which makes them more than the sum of their gimmicks. But the story kind of latches on to her as the poster child for this idea of the \"underdeveloped joke character\" which some fans would demand additional development well beyond reasonable expectation for the station she holds in the story. So some running gags emerge that focus on dragging poor Nepeta back down to irrelevance, or unfairly target her for tragic outcomes. Hence some \"dead Nepeta\" jokes that crop up here and there, which maybe seem cruel, but everything has its reason and fits into a greater order. In a way, Nepeta's arc could be seen as the struggle to ultimately free herself from the cycle of narrative marginalization and abuse.

As a psychic, he's aware of things on a lot of levels, such as future visions of doom and gloom, but he also seems intuitively aware of his place in the narrative as just a marginal cast member in a story containing people much more important than he is. His \"woe is me,\" \"why don't I just roll over and fucking die already\" attitude seems like it's connected to this basic awareness. In other words, his resigned sense of fatalism is inseparable from his narrative impotence, and the basic truth about him is that he was built to be little more than a serviceable part of a big machine.

It's an approach that resonates with the rest of Homestuck's governing principles involving simple platonic concepts giving rise to greater complexity and chaos. The Alpha Kid personalities in Act 6 are a much clearer demonstration of this principle as applied to character personas. This really is a whole can of worms, though.

While Hivebent continuously provides the scoop on what the facts of this culture are, it is simultaneously exploring certain nebulous ideas before fully committing to them. This is a very good strategy when it comes to improvisational worldbuilding. Also, can I just take a moment to acknowledge the fact that Sollux's typing quirk is a fucking disaster? Definitely one of the more challenging to parse, I think. But unlike other trolls, his quirk evolves to become more readable as he suffers physical ailments.\n\nThere's an awful lot going on up here too. Many points of lore and prophecy to earmark for later validation by the story. All of it does come to pass, in some way or another. The blindness, the dying twice stuff... Angels turn out to just be flying white monster things that either emerge from, or are composed of, the fearsome force of hope. That sounds kind of meaningless, and maybe it is, but that's what they are. Also, Terezi asking \"how does it know which angel to use...\" is a pretty confusing line without context. It's just a reference to a Sweet Bro comic, where he wonders what angle to use. I'm not sure a lot of these Sweet Bro and Hella Jeff funny quote shout-outs really hold up.

That's probably a pretty awkward fact to bring up, though. Come to think of it, as of this moment, I don't actually remember who is currently aware that Aradia is a ghost? Equius is, because he's building a robot body for her. Vriska PROBABLY is, because she killed her. But I believe everyone else is under the impression that she just...showed up again online after her \"accident,\" and therefore survived somehow.

Also her foreknowledge of the session appears to be nearly exhaustive, including knowledge of their ultimate failure. Maybe if Jade knew her session was doomed from the start, she wouldn't be quite so chipper?? Aradia even understands their failure will \"briefly masquerade as victory,\" which is absolutely right. This was an easy thing to foreshadow though, because I knew two big facts in advance. First, the trolls must \"win,\" because the kids' universe exists, and the trolls created it. Second, something must have gone wrong, because the trolls ended up getting trapped in some vague purgatory state, from which Karkat decided it would be a good idea to uselessly harass the human kids.

It's hard to overstate just how much of everything that happens traces back to his direct orchestration. Recall that he (creepily) raised Aradia's ancestor since she was a grub, and trained her to do his dirty work as the Handmaid. Aradia unwittingly follows in her footsteps with stunts like this.\n\nAradia just means she's gonna stop sulking in her frog hole, come up from the caverns, and put Sollux to sleep so he can't cause trouble. He has fully served his purpose, having programmed the game and gotten the two teams rolling.

(It's still entirely possible that's what's going on here.) But with the context provided later on, it seems \"ancestors\" here is actually referencing twelve very specific individuals who are figures of legend in troll history. It's even more likely it's referencing one ancestor in particular: Aradia's, the Handmaid. The Handmaid was groomed by Doc Scratch to serve Lord English by traveling around time causing all kinds of trouble throughout history, specifically to bring about these events. So unlike the other ancestors, the Handmaid is the only one whose job was actually to make all this stuff happen, thus making her the most logical target of this reference. This being the case, it raises the question of how Aradia was receiving \"instruction\" from the Handmaid. She can commune with the dead, but...the Handmaid isn't dead. She was cursed with immortality for as long as she serves English, and can hop around through time. So does this mean she met with Aradia in person at some point to dispense orders? It's entirely possible. If it happened after Aradia's death, it would also mean Aradia wasn't communing with a dead ancestor to receive instructions.

Of her many irons in the fire, some tend to be outsourced like this. In her self-obsession, she demands full credit nonetheless and expects to maximize the return on the investment she didn't even make, which is full amnesty for her past crimes.)

Fighting against the forces of narrative marginalization completely define her entire batshit arc, from her introduction here all the way to the end of Homestuck.

We're still in the process of learning that there even is a caste system.

The troll personas are related to internet culture archetypes, and hers is the first one that correlates pretty closely with fandom itself, at least as the cultural concept was taking shape at that time. Her obsession with shipping is closely connected to the focus on romance that Hivebent injected into Homestuck's bloodstream, forever contaminating it for better or worse. Parsing her as the enthusiastic proto-fandom avatar in this respect reveals her as the Calliope of the story before Calliope shows up in Act 6. However, Nepeta's claim to that ambassadorship was responded to by the narrative with arguably ill-spirited rebuke and mistreatment, which I think was something that evolved before I had the chance to sharpen and clarify any meaningful statement the story intended to make about such an avatar. That refinement happens later with Calliope's character, an enthusiastic fandom avatar who is in explicit danger from such forces, but who is otherwise elevated and designated for protection, revivification, and ultimately, amnesty from the story's various narrative retributions."

For one thing, it's a strong example of moirallegiance by troll standards. This is a minor point, though. For reasons that are hard to explain, this relationship is of cosmic significance in the grand scheme of the narrative. Arquius x Davepeta, as the terminal for their combined trajectory, illustrates its significance by seemingly placing it on near-equivalent terms with Dave and Dirk's relationship. Why the hell should this be true? Perhaps it's premature to say. I'll save that for the Act 6 book babbling. More generally, key relationship pairs bring a lot out of certain characters, even minor ones. For instance, you could write dozens of paragraphs of meta on Vriska alone. But the moment you stop writing about Vriska in a vacuum, and start writing about Vriska x Terezi, the avenues of analysis seem endless. It's a circuitous, psychologically tortured mutual arc of competitive codependency, which on closer inspection serves as the axis around which virtually the entire plot revolves. Equius and Nepeta bring things out of each other's arcs in a similar way, relative to their lesser roles in the story. They could have ended up being merely two fairly shallow extras swallowed up by a huge ensemble, but the interactions they have make it much harder to write off either of them individually.\n\nWe don't know much about Equius yet, but we get an awful lot of info about him with this excerpt. He's racist, a huge snob, doesn't like swearing, is stern and controlling, has a patronizing fondness for Nepeta, and thinks archery is cool because of its association with nobility. Combine this with the snapshot of his room we'll see soon, and suddenly we have an extensive character portrait. This was all important to establish quickly, because it helps us understand in record time that Equius is in fact one of the greatest characters ever created.\n\nBut wait, there's more. He also sweats a lot, he can't actually wield a bow and arrow because he's too strong and just breaks them, and he detests cruelty to animals, which he adores, especially humongous, nude, anthropomorphic beasts, which is something we don't need to get into now. There's plenty to say about Nepeta too, but when they're talking, it seems Equius starts to bury her in the contest of absurd, eyebrow-raising character traits. In this sense, she's sort of the straight man of the duo's relationship. But then, that's not a bad way to describe what a moirail really is. It's playing the stable, calming straight man to a more erratic or extreme personality, to help keep them grounded.\n\nMuch of Hivebent involves observing the characters we're in the process of getting to know find out how they're either not on the team they thought they'd be on or won't enter the session in the order they believed. Sometimes people get tricked, sometimes they get sabotaged, and sometimes they get ordered by an abusive friend who has no real power over them, except the power of sheer insistence they have grown accustomed to successfully asserting over the years. Also, there's no such thing as an abusive relationship for trolls, just lots of arrangements that are \"normal\" due to their terrible culture. There you go, that's my red-hot take of the day for you.\n\nEquius says he appreciates that Nepeta's angry. I guess meaning that he respects an angry disposition, like his own. Especially early on in his characterization, it's suggested he has anger issues (like him taking his rage out on robot dummy combatants). But I'm not sure this trait holds up. Over time, he seems to show a lot more passion about his weird stuff, his passion for archery and muscular horse men, his submissive obsessions, his deference toward those higher on the hemospectrum and fetish-like indulgence in depraved attraction toward those lower. Ultimately he comes off more as a ridiculous nerd, with a soft spot for a lot of silly and creepy shit. My view on this is, it's not that the text lost track of the fact that he was supposed to be angry. It's more that this was his initial state of mind early on, and the more he started blowing off steam with his various indulgences (Aradiabot, etc.) the less he had to be mad about. We just meet him at a really high-strung point in his life. I think it's more accurate to say his \"anger\" is a form of hyperintense focus on being stern, aloof, proper, and averse to nonsense, which is a facade serving to cover up his inner personality, which is barely in control at all. Like Nepeta suggests, deep down he wants to play the kinds of silly games she plays. He wants to let go completely, and indulge every ludicrous and depraved whim he has. His arc tends to be more about caving to these indulgences, and all the mixed consequences that follow, than resisting them.\n"

It contains many statements that aren't jokes exactly, just wise-assed things to say, as well as ways of saying things that could be said in a more sensible manner. Like, \"But not too far into the present.\" What the hell does this actually mean? We're hopping back to the \"present,\" but not so far back that we would have to officially begin calling it the future. In fact, going \"far into the present\" seems to be a preposterous concept, because the present is an exact point on a timeline. Falling short of the present, by a bit or a lot, is what we call the past. Exceeding it by a bit or a lot is what we call the future. Also none of this means anything, because Hivebent has made it pretty clear through its nonlinear presentation that there's no such thing as the present from our viewpoint. And to make this even less meaningful, no matter how far into Hivebent's \"future\" you go, it's still all taking place in the past, since it's explicitly presented as a long flashback in the greater story. The narration is always playing games with words to evocatively capture this stupid dance we're doing with ludicrous ideas and abstract concepts.\n\nHer olive branch remark is both a callback to when Karkat said something similar to John about becoming friends, as well as a reference to the infamous bull penis cane wielded by CD in the Midnight Crew Intermission. Quite a one-two punch. Vriska here is under the laughable impression she is going to be the secret leader of the blue team, but what else is new. Half these people all think they're either going to be the leader, or on the other team. It would make a lot of sense for Vriska to be on the blue team, which is what makes it so great that she's not. But she is an excellent fly in the ointment—or spider, if you will. Dropping this hot mess into the red team, an othervvise fairly coherent group of friends with good chemistry, is a good recipe for drama. Vriska is subsequently used as that kind of ointment-containminating ingredient almost ceaselessly for the rest of this Act.\n\nThis appears to be the only time in the story Vriska psychically controls Karkat. There are definitely limitations to her powers. Higher bloods are immune. Everyone from Terezi and up can resist her powers. Probably Kanaya too, since it's hard to imagine her being controlled. (Though whether that's due to her blood or temperament is an open question.) Trolls lower on the hemospectrum are fair game. Tavros, Sollux...probably Nepeta too, but why would Vriska bother with her? Aradia has some resistance due to being an advanced psychic herself, in a way that Sollux is not at his lower moments (see: brain problems). So, is Vriska being truthful that she can control Karkat but just doesn't want to because his mind is unpalatable? Or is there something about his mind that makes it genuinely difficult to control, and that's just her cover story? Maybe all she can pull off are these little things. \"Finger slips\" as little demonstrations of power, without being able to take full control.\n"

As Aradia's arc progresses and the ghostly freeze on her emotions and desires begins to thaw, one of the themes that starts emerging is the struggle over the nature of what is random in a universe where any appearance of randomness is prewritten as an essential result, and any act of destruction, no matter how violent or disruptive, only serves as a preconditional pillar for any foretold series of outcomes. As a robot, when she gets her emotional legs back under her somewhat, she gets more aggressive and starts lashing out, using acts of chaos, violence, impulsiveness, and randomness as a kind of protest against the bondage that existing in Paradox Space represents. In other words, there's no random act that reality hasn't accounted for, but aggressively enacting them is still kind of a Fuck You statement to the master.

When expanding on the roster in Hivebent, the creative challenge became crafting a diverse range of such profiles. And a corollary to this challenge was imagining what profile would maximize the qualities that make someone a troll in this sense. In other words, who is the most trollish troll in this group, what are the traits that someone fitting that description has, and what form will they take in terms of personality and role in the story? Vriska is the result of this effort, and one way of looking at her arc in the story is as a simple exploration of what it means to draft a character designed to have the ultimate troll profile. Being the ultimate troll doesn't necessarily mean being the biggest asshole (though there are times when she gets that award too). It means being the most controversial.

Whether she's the one forcing her way back into the spotlight all the time due to ego, or it's actually the narrative always pulling her back in as a preferred tool of effective melodrama, thus giving her a reputation as someone favored by the author as a vehicle for mayhem and controversy, is left for readers to decide.

The \"bad luck\" vs. \"good luck\" chapter of Vriska's arc is more of an Act 5 thing and becomes less relevant later.

More likely it's shorthand for a guilty conscience, and the bad karma associated with it. There's a hole in her soul, created by a life of misdeeds she won't face, and the struggles for success, treasure, victory, glory, and above all, relevance, are constant exertions throughout her very long journey in the vain and mostly unsuccessful attempt to fill this moral vacuum inside her.

Does Vriska like her and want to earn respect from her? Does she want her to go away? Vriska is the type who sucks up to people and wants approval from them if they show apathy toward her (Aradia), and shows disdain for those who do the opposite, either positively or negatively (Tavros), and Kanaya confusingly exhibits both traits. Too cool, too aloof for Vriska, but oh also, she cares a lot and wants to protect her from her own dangerous tendencies. Some of it reads as simple attraction to these types of girls, but a big part of it also has to do with Kanaya's strong maternal streak, the need to \"mother\" certain people. It doesn't seem that Vriska dislikes her per se, but unfortunately Kanaya's conflicted, concern-based approach to the relationship has dropped her right in the Friend Zone.

She just made some empty promise to Eridan to get him to do something for her. There's virtually no way she's ever interacted with him without dunking on him in some manner. Another funny thing about it is the fact that getting help from one of her \"pals nearby\" (Equius) probably just means she made him do almost all of the work and is taking full credit for it, just like she's doing with Aradiabot. Additional trivia: this art asset is just the doomsday dice cascader from a Problem Sleuth bonus page.

By retconning something back into any given moment in the story, is it being retconned into the true stream of events, with the panel simply displaying the single moment we are viewing? Or is it being retconned back into a specific panel, which should be seen as a narrative construct in and of itself, not merely an abstract viewport which has no acknowledgeable identity?

Though Equius is a notch higher on the hemospectrum, they're both blue- blooded aristocracy whose castes maintain both deep contempt for those lower and (especially in indigo cases) exceedingly high regard for those above. The fact that they're neighbors suggests there isn't that big a divide between blue and indigo in terms of status and daily life. Both classes probably cluster together somewhat in a kind of snobby symbiosis, since they're one notch below purple-blooded clown hell, which is a radically different kind of cultural aristocracy. And both are one notch above the jade and teal middling classes, which enjoy some status, but both castes revolve around more functional, municipal services such as breeding administration and law enforcement. But on just a character level, there are a couple echos here. Vriska obsessively breaks 8-balls in a way \"bordering on fetishistic.\" Equius does the same with bows. Both for different reasons. For her, relating to her obsession and frustration with her luck. For him, obsession and frustration with his strength, something that he loves about himself but which prohibits him from doing another thing he loves. Fetishizing destruction and chaos for reasons along these lines is a theme that runs through this group, especially when you include Aradia's fixation on it as well."

By the very nature of trolls, a lot of these guys were always going to be pretty bad, obnoxious, gross, or creepy, particularly at first glance. So one major challenge I found interesting was something like, \"How do you introduce someone who appears to be almost instantly revolting or objectionable, and then proceed to make the reader love this person against all odds?\" Equius is probably the strongest example up to this point of me embracing this idea as a challenge. The initial impressions he gives are pretty horrible. He's constantly angry, racist, humorless, has weird horse porn everywhere, and...oh no, does he BEAT HIS LUSUS TOO?? Just awful. But the unfolding of his character thereafter reveals certain mitigating truths. He doesn't beat his lusus, he's just so strong he leaves bruises despite his best efforts at tenderness. It's like a disability he struggles with. If you want to go full sadstuck, picture him unable to hug his dear moirail upon meeting her, for fear of crushing her fragile bones. There are many small ways his portrait is guided so that a guy who really has no right to be seen as endearing ends up being strangely so, often in ways that aren't even easy to explain.

There's some irony that Equius engages in a sort of daily roleplay routine with Gamzee while admonishing Nepeta for her attempts to get him to roleplay with her in a more \"frivolous\" way. She probably doesn't have the slightest idea he does this every day.\n\nEquius thrashes between ordering people what to do, and then when they do it, becoming dissatisfied and realizing that he really wants them to be doing what he wants them to do under their own volition, and also for them to tell HIM what to do, whether they're of a higher or lower caste. This is a mess, and is probably why these two talk so much. It's an endlessly circular fetish, and it never resolves itself. Timeline-wise, this conversation locates them after Gamzee has entered the game. The red team has a good jump on the blue team, already three players deep while the first blue (Equius) hasn't entered yet. Not a super important detail, but it's worth tracking this stuff in the background somewhat, because the order of entry tells us certain things, like who had to work with (or put up with) whom as a server player. Karkat deals with Terezi (we saw how that went), Terezi deals with Gamzee (notable when you know their long-range arc), Gamzee deals with Tavros (thank god for offscreen conversations, let's just leave it at that), Tavros deals with Vriska (Oh No), and Vriska deals with Kanaya (mom to the rescue).\n\nMaybe this is the first conversation they've ever had where they openly acknowledge that what they're doing is roleplaying? Let's call it a breakthrough. It's also telling that in Gamzee's honest attempt to RP, he goes straight for the goatdaddy issues. A bit sad really. Is this conversation over yet? Oh, there's one more page.\n\nEquius has a quirk with a fair amount to consider. As the Sagittarius, and therefore centaur-themed troll, the \"cent\" part of centaur makes 100 his magic number and percent signs his favored symbol. He replaces the phoneme \"loo\" in words with \"100,\" even when the original word isn't spelled that way, like \"b100.\" And he swaps in % signs for x's, but more confusingly, also for x phonemes, so \"bricks\" becomes \"bri%.\" He does this even for sounds that are just close to x, like \"distinction\" becoming \"distin%ion.\" And sometimes he replaces an entire word semantically related to the % symbol, like \"cross.\" I ended up really milking this quirk, mostly because I knew that only swapping instances of x would not yield a lot of changes and so would feel kind of insubstantial.\n"

Recall that it was left ambiguous in a scene with Aradia who she was referencing as co-leader, whether it was Vriska or a different blue-blooded troll. They all seem to think they're playing each other. Equius is probably the closest to being right. Notice how Equius knows exactly what he's doing here, at every step of the way. When he says \"I'll deliver it shortly,\" he doesn't say who he's delivering it to. He's playing Vriska, and he thinks he's playing Aradia by giving her a body he's \"tampered\" with. But Aradia outplays him on that front in the end too.\n\nOf course, the fact is that everyone's playing everyone else, and all involved know what a bunch of backstabbing assholes they all are, so attempts to follow through with planned collusion sort of devolve into this slapstick banter where they clearly seem to suspect they're all about to double-cross each other. This is also another look at the Obsequious Vriska persona, who rears her head with anyone who is notably aloof, harsh, or disdainful to her regularly. It makes sense that this has become the standard repartee between them over the years. Equius's personality is pretty stable, but hers is in wild flux depending on who she's talking to. A Paradox Space comic I wrote shows off this dynamic pretty well too, where she sucks up to him after her arm got blown off, hoping he'd build a new one for her. On this note, there's also decent supporting evidence that Vriska has some sort of crush on Equius, but possibly only on a physical basis. Maybe the best case for this is how she went gaga when she saw Nic Cage from Con Air, with his sweaty muscles, long greasy hair, and dirty wifebeater. She absolutely lost it, and Equius looks exactly the fucking same. So, while she may not \"like\" him technically, in a personal way, her crush is the kind where she finds some dude so outrageously and inexplicably hot, he completely ruins her ability to keep composure or think rationally.

Just put them in the trash, and focus on this. It's the arguable axis around which the whole epic revolves, when you really study all the ramifications from the fallout resulting from their rivalry, ensuing revenge cycle, and mutually floundering struggle for redemption, in the warped way each of them defines that idea. The \"truce\" they refer to here roughly covers the conditions surrounding their entire tandem arc. An uneasy agreement to set aside their vicious, competitive tendencies to allow for a stable friendship, even though the friendship seems entirely based on their deep need for these competitive behavior patterns to play themselves out. The truce in a sense is an acknowledgement of an unhealthy codependency, an addiction to the negative qualities and drama they bring out in each other and in everyone around them who gets pulled into it. And as we know from two blue blood intros already, addiction is a powerful thing.\n\nVriska's \"You'll see\" warnings come across as heavy-handed foreshadowing of something. So much so that we cast about for things we already know about Terezi.

Maybe not a bad guess, if prior story data is all we have to go on.

It also conveys Terezi's attitude as having a sense of \"responsibility\" toward handling Vriska, partly due to their darkly codependent relationship, but also due to Terezi's attitude toward justice. Terezi views herself, almost exclusively, as a dispenser of justice. Exclusively, because she's the only one she knows who cares about justice, and considers morality in those terms. Therefore, if anyone else punishes Vriska, it's merely revenge. Whereas if she does it, it's delivering justice, and hence throughout their mutual arc, Terezi continues to see Vriska as her \"responsibility\" and views herself as the only one who can cause Vriska to face justice for her misdeeds. Vriska, however, does not see things in terms of justice but rather in terms of a fungible, ever-rationalizable personal morality, making her a strong foil for Terezi's desire to pursue justice.

He's always there at the right moment to nudge people in the direction of doing the nasty thing that, deep down, they already know they want to do. Like any self-respecting devil figure would. A couple pages ago, you might have noticed Terezi and Aradia alluding to his presence, when Tavros was in the process of jumping off the cliff. He asked them for help, but they didn't answer. The reason apparently was that Doc was distracting them, to ensure Vriska had the time to get the job done. It also seems likely he egged her on too, given what he's saying to her here. Maybe he'd been inflaming her contempt for Tavros leading up to that moment as well? Whispering things in her ear about what a loser he is, how he'll never become strong without her \"help.\" He'd surely know just what buttons to push.\n\nOne reading of Doc is as a manipulative devil-creep in the model of many fictional characters who fit this description; he's a fairly recognizable and traditional presence in the story, when viewed that way. A less traditional reading centers on his role on a metatextual level, as a nefarious, all-knowing, profoundly evil alt-author presence. A guy who has the full powers of the author, who essentially IS the author with certain dark authorial impulses greatly exaggerated, while functioning as a character in the story who can speak to and influence other characters in support of an evil agenda. (That is, the summoning of yet another, even more satanic alt-author being into the comic.) Viewed this way, his conversations with other characters take on a different quality. Normally, the author remains a disguised presence and influences the thoughts of characters with an unseen hand, simply by writing their thoughts directly into their heads, their words into their mouths. This alt-author is essentially doing the same thing, but as an actual character and a known presence to those he influences. He whispers in their ears, gets them to do the nasty, terrible things that are latent within their nature to do, which I as the unseen author easily could have done myself through a conventional writing process. But I outsourced that dark influence to this guy, thus establishing him as a narrative construct in the story on the same level as, but at odds with, the actual author. This surreptitiously lays the groundwork for a future point of tension: a narrative war between an Idiot God and a Genius Devil. Which, admittedly, when the shit finally hits the fan, mostly reads as one buffoon's struggle with a figment of his imagination, in the form of a wrestling match with a floppy, inanimate puppet. It's actually the perfect metaphor signifying the creative rocess behind this comic.\n\nDoc here refers to the dark spots, the pockets of void on which his vision is built. These hint at limitations to his omniscience. As an alt-author figure, his omniscience makes sense, since the author has sweeping knowledge of story details as well. Because I \"know everything,\" he \"knows everything\" too. Of course, as I write the story, there are plenty of things I don't know yet, and the \"not knowing\" is always an important part of the process in this largely improvisational medium. The known gaps are worked into the story, evaded through time skips and other tricks, filling out the surrounding narrative until certain answers become clearer, and then revealed at the right moment. The voids are built around, and in a real way, become foundational, almost load-bearing gaps in knowledge, just as he describes. Pillars of shadow. So his dark spots are not only a limitation to an otherwise ridiculously overpowered villain that can be exploited, they're a feature of a specific type of \"authorial omniscience\" copied into his profile."

This one is a special bifurcated session, though, as it says there. That means it has one usual set of ruins, which always end up next to the Forge. (The volcano there. All sessions start with one of those, except void sessions.) And also that the future site for one of the player's homes is nearby, like Jade, Kanaya, or Jake. But the underground Rogue Ruins site is quite anomalous to a session's starting planet. It makes sense that it's underground, hidden from view, and associated with Aradia.

She basically just lives in Jade's house, with her own personal touches strewn about. She, like Jade, has sort of a combo-breaking quality in the stream of character introductions. The nine previous to her grew up in situations that were typical for trolls within their classes, so introducing them doubled as a good way to get to know troll culture. Now that we have some context, we can start identifying departures from those norms. Leaving the sea dwellers for last also fits in with this reasoning. It's hard to appreciate what it means to be aristocratic until it's understood what it means to be common. Saving these three for last is part of that overall design and is also why, in her intro, Kanaya quickly starts talking to Eridan and Feferi.

Most trolls have a dash of cheesy pop culture linked to their profile. With Kanaya, if you're detecting notes of Twilight, you're not crazy. This also signals that jade bloods are rare relative to populations of other classes. Hard to say how rare, exactly. Considering she gets the \"one of the few of your kind\" refrain, jade bloods probably have the smallest population of any individual class, aside from fuchsia (which numbers exactly one on the entire planet, as you'll see soon). It's a class that has more to with breeding administration than other types of grunt work, for which much bigger populations would be more useful. Even so, Kanaya seems to be more notable than the average member of her class (which, admittedly, is true for most of these characters), in that she was chosen by a virgin mother grub. Her later-revealed vampiric qualities also seem to be unusual for her class, although I don't think it's ever really confirmed how unusual or common that trait is among jades. Since in the main Homestuck narrative we only ever get one solid example of each blood type, it tends to be left as a point of speculation how representative that one character is of the rest of their class.\n\nIt seems this is the first clear confirmation that Kanaya is awake on Prospit while she sleeps? It may have been hinted at before, but now all doubt is removed. Again, just like Jade. We'll need to put a pin in that and remember to keep an eye out for why it's true. Also like Jade, she has a wardrobifier. But unlike Jade, she actually likes a wide variety of fashion, which she sews herself. So she actually gets some good use out of it, rather than cycling through a bunch of silly tee-shirts. The chainsaw-to-lipstick is some standard item duality inherited from Problem Sleuth, like Snowman's lance/cigarette holder. But in this case, this particular item actually existed in the other story and was the weapon/cosmetic of choice for Hysterical Dame.

Then we finally get to hear all the things the story never gave her a chance to say. It's really a poignant moment of redemption for her legitimacy as a character.\n\nI was lying. Being EXCIT--ED isn't all there is to Feferi. She also leads us into the concept of moirallegiance and provides an exemplary model of a long-suffering moirail to a very unpleasant and problematic person. She does a good job as the portrait of someone in a bad relationship they feel unable to get out of, but this case comes with an additional layer of duty, since a moirail's social role is to help neutralize the threat your dangerous friend may represent to others. So breaking up with them carries an even higher cost, and therefore raises the stakes of guilt. Feferi also has a \"duty to the throne\" to consider. So to whatever extent we can isolate her marginal arc for examination, there seem to be themes of finding the gumption to liberate herself from various duties and burdens, both for her own sense of happiness and the greater good for her people.

Not unreasonably, since Kanaya's stated task is to keep an eye on Vriska for her own good. But that's kind of a mixed signal she's sending, since clearly she has other designs; notice how she says she doesn't \"want her to be that,\" implying she'd rather Vriska was something more. This gives us a glimpse into the psychology surrounding troll romance, which we're only still figuring out through inference. Sometimes trolls get locked into quadrants, or trap themselves into them through mixed signals, as Kanaya has done. Similar to getting \"friend zoned\" by a crush, but with even more exotic social compartments to get stuck in. For instance, if you have a red crush on someone, and your strategy is to neg them into liking you, then whoops, you might end up in the black quadrant instead."

Setting up a thing she has a burning need to do --> ongoing, mighty struggle to do the thing, with many setbacks --> final success in doing the thing, which works out great --> the end. Even the basic premise of Homestuck as a heroic journey for the protagonists isn't like that. They do end up creating a universe in the end, after a ridiculous number of setbacks.

Earlier I referred to Nepeta as being somewhat a writeup of the enthusiastic fandom type, which could be summarily branded as the \"Tumblr fangirl.\" And in that sense, she reads as a less focused rough draft of Calliope, who brought more clarity to that role later. So thinking in those terms, you could also view Eridan as a writeup of the \"4chan nastyboy,\" and therefore an unfocused draft of Caliborn, who similarly distilled that role. I think there's a lot to say about Eridan, particularly as a raw precursor to that villainous presence in the story later. I'll wait until he's on-screen before diving into that, though. Just setting up here! You've been warned.\n\nThe fact that Eridan's being so loose with strange romantic terms is how you know we're getting awfully close to the troll romance info dump. It's like a Geiger counter that's starting to beep like crazy. Eridan has something in common with Karkat in that he appears well versed in the subject of romance. Later we see that, even though they don't like each other much, they sort of act like \"bros\" when it comes to this subject. However, Karkat treats the subject more academically, with a sort of hobbyist's enthusiasm, and seems to carry a certain respect for the knowledge. Whereas Eridan clearly tries to exploit his knowledge of romance to his advantage, behaves manipulatively, sort of in the vein of a pickup artist (and a very unsuccessful one at that). We detect signs of this here. His entire scheme with the doomsday device appears to have more to do with roping Vriska into a blackrom relationship than it does with his interest in wiping out land dwellers (still a valid motivation, but secondary to his sad romantic pursuits). He also uses his romantic insights to manipulate people in other ways, even if he's not trying to court them. Like pinning Kanaya down as a natural auspistice and using it to get her to set him up with Vriska. Maybe even \"mediate\" between them, since that's what she apparently likes to do with Vriska anyway. In fact, the more you unpack what he's doing here, if you understand the ashen quadrant, the more it actually seems like he is hitting on Kanaya, with kind of a backdoor approach. He's proposing a menage-a-clubs, with him and Vriska. He literally never stops working all possible angles to fill his quadrants.\n\nThe only reason I made him say \"powwwwoww\" is because I wanted to type four w's in a row. This should be obvious to everyone. It's worth pausing here to behold how completely ridiculous Eridan's entire verbal existence is, when you take into account his silly double w/v quirk, which conveys an absurd \"accent\" of some sort, his run-on cadence, unyieldingly indignant tone, and colorful vocabulary that feels like a baffling mashup of pirate speak, soccer hooliganism, and the fuckboy joker always sliding into your DMs. His eclectic vocabulary and obsession with romance means that we suddenly get this whole rush of quadrant vernacular we hadn't heard before. Which is pretty intriguing on a worldbuilding basis, to start picking up how many average trolls probably allude to each other's romantic habits in casual conversation. Things like being \"ruddy\" for someone, or waxing this way or that. There's a whole manner of speaking about this stuff that can only be picked up through enough exposure to contextual banter.\n\nOkay, \"savvvvy\" was just another excuse to type four v's in a row. Calling myself out here at every turn. \"Being a kid and growing up. It's hard and nobody understands\" is another Homestuck tagline. I'm just going to keep making note of these when I see them. They will always do one of the following: 1) reference dying too much 2) address the difficulties of growing up 3) involve the fact that nobody ever really knows what the hell is going on 4) insinuate in some way that I am a buffoon, a liar, a sadist, or a megalomaniacal genius, or 5) all of the above.

This provides us with a lot of retroactive perspective on all the Rose-Kanaya conversations we've read. There is a tone of bitterness and scorn running through Kanaya's earlier dialogue with Rose that isn't fundamental to her personality otherwise. This explains why. Kanaya is underwhelmed and disillusioned with her heroine of legend, so she begins by cooperating with Karkat's trolling orders and treats Rose with nothing but derision. It's only a bit later, when Rose starts holding her own in certain conversations and pulls off a few badass moves for the camera, that Kanaya's earlier heroine-crush starts to rekindle itself."

Some things she says could easily be some things I say, undisguised by her voice. In a way, all characters with significant roles can be seen as an author mouthpiece, representing a certain splinter of the author's perspective. The core of Vriska's initial profile—the ultimate troll and supreme source of controversy—has the secondary effect of creating a portrait of an individual who heaps scorn on characters deemed as weak, and who persecutes or torments them to put them in situations that force them to grow and evolve. Which is exactly what an author is supposed to do with fictional characters. To challenge them, break them down, force hard decisions, prompt evolution, and let them build themselves back up or die trying.

Not necessarily all of it, but certain characters, events, and conditions. It's not as ill-willed as it might sound, but more of a universal principle of storytelling that for things to be interesting, harsh outcomes must befall those you create, in response to which they may thrive or fail. Which to the casual observer may read as hate. \"Why did the author hate this character so much?\" is a question some ask of fiction that is harsh to its occupants. It isn't \"true hate,\" but something else, a necessary degree of authorial viciousness to produce the right kinds of tension, which is tempered and balanced by an opposite force, authorial affection for a creation, which can express itself in extremes too, like various kinds of indulgence. These forces are explored symbolically in a more coherent sense later, but I think the themes begin to develop as Vriska's portrait comes into better focus, as a vessel for this particular kind of scorn, one obsessed with challenging others in cruel ways to force them to overcome their limitations and get stronger. As the \"most favored character,\" it makes sense that she would echo this authorial attitude.

If Vriska is the current mouthpiece for authorial scorn, Kanaya counters with authorial affection. While Vriska wants to throw weaklings into the water to sink or swim, Kanaya prefers to support them with maternal concern. Acting as this sort of authorial mouthpiece is not a huge part of Kanaya's character, but it comes through in the right context. And anyway, like I said, these ideas were very raw in Hivebent, emerging as sketches and loose themes to build on later. The concept of authorial scorn—or actually, \"wrath,\" as a better term—comes into sharper focus in Act 6 through certain avatars. Pushing further the thesis that there is a part of any creator that \"hates\" the creation, everything inside it, and even those outside it (such as fandom), leads to a metafictional examination of what happens when those forces are fully unleashed and spin out well beyond the author's control. As if to say, a monster has been summoned, and once loose, operates autonomously of the author at great cost to everyone and everything inside the story, and, to some extent, outside. This is basically the crux of Lord English as symbolic figure, through his emergence and how he \"presides\" over the story thereafter, casting a pall of hate, terror, and destruction over the narrative itself. A symbolic counterbalance exists too, an elevated personification of affection for everything in the story, in the form of Calliope. Anyway, that's a WHOLE lot of shit to get into under a page where Vriska sends the Pshoooes! code to give Tavros a rocket."

          "content": "Okay, back into graduate thesis mode. Who was I even kidding with that. This page is a really good example of how Homestuck has a policy of trivializing its own \"background lore.\" It's a bit flippant and exceedingly non-precious about points of lore that would otherwise take center stage as a focal point of intrigue in other fantasy stories. Homestuck does this consistently, often aggressively, with almost an air of derision toward the idea that anyone would actually want to focus on the substance of Sburb's mythological challenge to the players, the dungeon crawling, the secrets, the puzzles. That's why this frog puzzle feels like kind of a background joke rather than anything that could possibly matter to the story. I'm making sure the reader is always being reminded that the substance of the quest, which normally would be THE quest and explicit focus of such stories, is just a farcical backdrop to the actual foreground story. Which is about kids bullshitting with each other, the focus on their characters and themes, and the struggles along the way of their coming-of-age journey. The \"Quest,\" and later the \"Narrative Itself\" simply serve as convoluted, hostile, and usually satirical environments for that journey. They are analogues for life itself, or the hostile world we must grow up in, full of the many absurd and pointless quest-like regimentations of society. Vriska here again functions as a sort of mouthpiece for authorial scorn toward elements of his creation. She derides these puzzles as a boring and useless expenditure of her time and interest, as well as the reader's. But this expression of scorn is just an accurate observation about the story itself. The story isn't about this stuff, and her inclination to hack or cheat her way through Sburb is actually an insightful reflection of the priorities and logic of Homestuck.\n\nHere Vriska is going on at greater length, saying almost what I just said, but from the perspective of a cutthroat gamer rather than story analysis. There's a lot of moralization that happens in stories, particularly those meant for young people. Little lessons built into everything we consume, which have a way of indoctrinating us on how to consume all stories forever. We always look for the moral of the story, the lessons of right vs. wrong, sort of unconsciously. \"Cheating = bad\" is a recognizable moral of this kind, so when we see her ranting here about the need to cheat, as consumers of moral tales our alarm bells go off. \"This is a bad person who has an immoral ethos, and she will likely be punished for this later, and we should want that as readers,\" The problem with this view is, of course, it's just not that simple. As a matter of valor and integrity, in a vacuum, yes, cheating is bad and immoral. However, in a situation you know to be rigged against you in certain ways, full of hurdles and milestones that are fundamentally meaningless, or even in some ways designed to mess with you or hold you back, is cheating then okay? Does it even count as cheating anymore, or is \"cheating\" just a negative word for what's actually the correct and logical solution to a murky problem, partially designed to deceive you and waste your time? This is part of what makes Vriska an intrinsic wedge character. She's always walking through the uncanny valley of morality with just about everything she says and does.\n\nVriska's \"cheating\" policy, as a matter of cutting through the bullshit and embracing a strategy of speed-running Sburb to whatever extent possible, actually isn't a remotely bad idea in the context of their session. It seems to be very effective, and though there are a lot of bumps along the way, the trolls actually kick their session's ass and win fair and square. The universe/frog they create turns out to be fruit from a poison tree, but that really isn't their fault. We are somewhat led to believe they had a flawed approach to this game, and were karmically punished for it when they tried to claim their reward. But that's mostly due to Karkat's projection and self-loathing rather than a true karmic sentence enforced by the text in response to their shortcuts and other \"moral indiscretions.\" From the reader standpoint, it's tempting to parse it this way, I think again due to being so well-trained to view stories on such moralistic terms, where rewards come to those who do things the right way, and punishment to those who don't. Characters themselves are motivated to see things this way too, because they, like us, cut their teeth on tales with such morals. So Karkat, and many other characters, are prone to evaluating what happens to them in the terms of \"the way stories typically work,\" which actually is a faulty perspective, verging on being tragic. The only conclusion to draw then, I believe, is this: it's wrong to interpret their misfortune after victory as punishment for either their moral failings or their approach to playing the game. A take I saw fairly often went something like, \"The trolls speedran the game, skipping over important challenges that were key to their personal growth, which led to their downfall.\" This is a misleading and superficial spin on what happened. It gives too much credit and authority to Sburb's various regimentations as legitimate authenticators of one's \"personal growth.\" They are not. Sburb has never been what it appears to be. Not to the players, and not to us.\n"

But these are ridiculous kids who barely have a handle on what the hell they're actually doing when it comes to amorous activity. Even though the troll kids are technically the same age as the humans (albeit in different time units), it's still hard to imagine the humans doing anything like this until a few more years have time-skipped by (see: Act 6). It's fair to say trolls are just forced to grow up faster. A more violent, brutal culture, more self-sufficient upbringing without adult influence, a society revolving around more intense romantic conventions, and a forced breeding program mandated by the government. Factors like this are liable to encourage kids to start acting a lot older than they are."

The symbol for one suit, a heart, symbolizes romance for humans. The question following almost naturally after that, if you're just a little bit nuts, is: what if, in a different culture, the other three suits represent different kinds of romance? It's like an exponential expansion of the idea. One suit, a heart, is a 1^1 grid, singular, simplistic. One data point, which by itself implies no pattern. Whereas four suits expands the realm of romance geometrically, to 2^2, which is where the notion of a grid, or \"quadrants\" begins to take shape. And once we're talking about quadrants, further organizing principles present themselves. What do the red suits have in common? The black? How about similarity by shape? (The heart naturally corresponds to the spade, and therefore evokes its opposite.) Believe it or not, this stuff actually does start designing itself. That's how you know the shit is real.

It's also worth noting the existence of this quadrant culturally arises from the need to suppress trolls' general inclination to devolve into blackrom sluts.

Romantic life for trolls is pretty dramatic. Hence the need for the pale relationships, which serve as social stabilizers. When you look at it that way, it starts to make more sense why the escalation of romantic complexity isn't linear, it's geometric. In other words, to expand on our human \"system,\" you can't really just add a spade and be done with it. You're adding too much drama. So you need another two to counterbalance. So a 1^1 system becomes a 2^2 grid. Extrapolating further, to add another heart- or spade-equivalent symbol to that, you'd realistically be stretching the system out to a 3^3 grid.

By now I've said lots of stuff about how Hivebent has been the environment for many smaller \"rough draft\" themes expressed through characters who start to hint at profiles that are brought into sharper focus later using different avatars. For example, Nepeta (romance-obsessed fangirl) as a proto-Calliope, the counter to which is Eridan (romance-obsessed, in a different way, nastyboy) as a proto-Caliborn. Caliborn and Calliope have a lot more substance to their symbolism, as well as additional layers that connect to what you might call The Point of Homestuck itself, as a more comprehensive creative statement. The portraits in Hivebent, the Nepeta/Eridan fangirl/nastyboy profiles, are more shallow and superficially comedic. Which isn't to say they aren't good characters. It's just that, in Eridan's case especially, the profile is almost purely political. He's the dude online who has egregious, patently evident problems with women, the way he talks about them and behaves toward them. The guy who feels entitled to their time and affection, and for this reason, struggles to win either. Everybody knows who this guy is. The profile is fundamentally rooted in misogynistic rancor, and everything else revolves around that—his loneliness, his foul temper, his attraction toward conquering and genocide, and eventually, his murderous rage. His effective self-radicalization over the course of the story, as happens so often in reality, stems from these issues."

Her arc in total...not so much. Which is a shame, because it results in her being near the bottom rung in terms of overall screen time and word count among major characters. Them's the breaks, though. In a cast of 500, not everyone gets to be a superstar. Still, there are things about her worth examining and celebrating, so let's do that. Like Kanaya, who has the \"few of your kind\" refrain, Feferi has \"only of your kind,\" because it's literally true. There's one pink blood at a time on this world, except the Condesce, who's always out there somewhere. Her royal ambition seems to be to duplicate the conditions of peace on Beforus, possibly including the part where they care for the underprivileged to an extent that may be overbearing. Beforus, instead of having stratified brutal oppression, was more like a stratified nanny state. Feferi seems to display this inclination with her adoption of wildlife, which doesn't need caring for either. They're cared for because she wants it, not them, which is Beforus life in a nutshell. In this sense, the Alternia heiress (Feferi) and Beforus heiress (Meenah) possess reverse mentalities. Feferi craves the order and over-caring of Beforus, while Meenah craves the chaos and exploitation of Alternia (unsurprisingly, since she's the teen Condesce)."

This isn't me throwing shade at her, it's just how she's supposed to be. Kind of a regular kid who gets excited about regular kid stuff, doesn't have a wild, ostentatious personality or glaring defects like most other trolls. She's an average, fun-loving kid leading the life of the least average kid on the planet, and she wants to make the best of her situation, whether it's inheriting the throne (where she would bring peace to the planet) or saying goodbye to the world and playing the game (which she knows will happen, because her lusus told her it would). Like Aradia, Feferi is okay with a lot of things, but she slides through adversity easily with the power of enthusiasm rather than apathy. The only other character I can think of with \"averageness\" as a built-in feature of her profile is Jane. Who is also a Life player, and an heiress to a different throne (occupied by, yet again, the Condesce). Returning to the idea that most of these characters tend to be composites of various constituent building-block personas, or platonic ideals of certain character types, we appear to be isolating another ingredient here: Janeness. Or Feferiness, depending on how you look at it. I'm more inclined to see Jane as a distillation of a rough idea that began here, since that's the pattern which keeps playing itself out over this Hivebent reread."

And like most fuckboys who make a habit of this, he comes armed with literally no engaging material whatsoever to back up his impulse to bother her. The formula for the fidgety fuckboy basically goes something like, \"hey\", \"hi, what's up?\", \"nothin\", \"oh\", \"...\", \"so what's on your mind?\", \"i dunno\", \"then why did you contact me?\", \"uhhhh\", \"sigh\", \"send nudes???\". Except instead of resorting to the send nudes part, Eridan's go-to subject is just to start grumbling about his genocidal aspirations.\n\nFeferi's quirk, I gotta admit, is another rough one. Swapping H with )( just turns out to be a tough read, IMO. It's definitely a good idea, visually referencing the Pisces symbol in that way, similar to how Eridan references his wavy symbol (and accent, apparently) with vv and ww. But it doesn't do the eye any favors in terms of readability, and possibly contributed to my disinclination to give Feferi much dialogue in the story. Note later how Meenah doesn't have this quirk, unless she's shouting.\n\nIt seems Feferi is cleverly laying the groundwork for her own imminent breakup with Eridan by offering counsel on his frustration with Vriska: \"Sometimes people just drift away I t)(ink, or just aren't as into t)(e quadrant as t)(e ot)(er wants to be.\" I'm sure this is relatable to many. It's a tough job, breaking up with a dude like this. Like defusing a bomb. She also references his tight bro-relations with Karkat, who he probably spills his feelings to all the time, like his red crush on Feferi. That's why he tenses up at the idea of having romantic realtalk with Feferi, the way moirails are \"supposed\" to. He bristles at their pale relationship because he wants it to be something more. Everything going on here barely needs to be couched in terms of quadrants. It's completely relatable on human terms. And therein lies the truth of our tour through troll culture. It's really just a look at humanity, which has been dressed up with a bit of outlandish and generally satirical alien worldbuilding elements. But that describes a lot of sci-fi, doesn't it.\n\nFeferi's facetious shocked reaction to speculating on Eridan waxing scarlet for a guy instead of a girl has the familiar heteronormative ring to it you'd expect to overhear in a conversation in human culture. Hivebent never makes a big deal of explicitly stating that trolls are an overwhelmingly bisexual race, but you start to gather that from context on a longer-term basis. On the subject of troll society just being a farcical veneer for human society and examining things relatable on human terms, you get a lot of moments like this, where statements and certain presumptions by characters have very human-centric perspectives that bleed into the text. Homestuck is not exceedingly strict about keeping the tone square with a precise reflection of alien cultural literalism. You could look at this in a couple ways. Either I could just be getting a little lazy sometimes, and I'm just letting human-centric worldviews, customs, verbal patterns, etc., leak into the text because it's just easier doing it that way (YA GOT ME). Or you could view it as a more critical choice to keep characters, interactions, and situations more relatable, more tonally in keeping with presenting this arc as a loosely crafted, humorous sci-fi romp, and shifting the focus toward other elements besides some maniacally constructed xenosociological study. Personally, I tend to gravitate toward explanations for things that make me sound like less of a shithead.\n"

Dave's involved with shitty swords, i.e. false/brittle talismans of ersatz heroism, which break, and the broken sword symbolism linked to his identity is something he must contend with in his journey, deriving whatever meaning from it that he can. Eridan's shitty wands, i.e. false talismans of magic, known and disdained for their fakeness attribute, serve to challenge him to override that fakeness through anger and determination, as well as the channeling of his aspect, Hope, as a means of conquering the forces of impotence ruling his identity, which the useless wands seem to physically embody.

It also implies that dispensing with a quirk conveys a sense of seriousness. But many trolls have had many serious and emotional conversations while just continuing on with their quirk, no problem. They probably get so used to the quirks that they don't even notice when a very serious moment would warrant dropping the act for a bit. I'd compare it to wearing a huge, ridiculous hat virtually every moment of your life, and you only bother to take it off for the most somber moments possible, like when you break up with someone.

Or, the \"real story\" is more of a self-understood projection of narrative idealism, around which revolve many orbital layers of farcical deconstruction.

          "content": "Honestly, it would be a pretty strong move if over the next couple pages, I just pasted all the troll romance exposition again into the author notes section underneath. Oh, you don't think I'll do it?????????\n\nThe problem is that when the subject of troll romance is broached, our sparing human intellects instantly assume the most ingratiating posture of surrender imaginable. But we will do our best to understand regardless. Humans have only one form of romance. And though we consider it a complicated subject, spanning a wide range of emotions, social conventions, and implications for reproduction, it is ultimately a superficial slice of what trolls consider the full body of romantic experience. Our concept of romance, in spite of its capacity to fill our art and literature and to rule our individual destinies like little else, is still just that. A single, linear concept. A concept usually denoted by a single symbol. <3 Troll romance is more complicated than that. Troll romance needs four symbols. Their understanding of romance is divided into halves, and halved again, producing four quadrants: the FLUSHED QUADRANT, the CALIGINOUS QUADRANT, the PALE QUADRANT, and the ASHEN QUADRANT. Each quadrant is grouped by the half they share, whether horizontally or vertically, depending on the overlapping properties one examines. The sharpest dichotomy, from an emotional perspective, is drawn between RED ROMANCE and BLACK ROMANCE. RED ROMANCE, comprised of the flushed and pale quadrants, is a form of romance rooted in strongly positive emotions. BLACK ROMANCE, with its caliginous and ashen quadrants, is rooted in the strongly negative. On the other hand, the vertical bifurcation has to do with the purpose of the relationship, regardless of the emotions behind it. Those quadrants which are CONCUPISCENT, the flushed and caliginous, have to do with facilitating the elaborate reproductive cycle of trolls. Those which are CONCILIATORY, the pale and ashen, would be more closely likened to platonic relationships by human standards. There are many parallels between human relationships and the various facets of troll romance. Humans have words to describe relationships of a negative nature, or of a platonic nature. The difference is, for humans, those relationships would never be conceptually grouped with romance. Establishing those sort of relationships for humans is not driven by the same primal forces that drive our tendency to couple romantically. But for trolls, those primal forces involve themselves in the full palette of these relationships, red or black, torrid or friendly. Trolls typically feel strongly compelled to find balance in each quadrant, and seek gratifying relationships that each describes. The challenge is particularly tortuous for young trolls, who must reconcile the wide range of contradictory emotions associated with this matrix, while understanding the nature of their various romantic urges for the first time. Of course, young humans have this challenge too. But for trolls, the challenge is fourfold. When two individuals find themselves in the flushed quadrant together, they are said to be MATESPRITS. Matespritship is the closest parallel to the human concept of romance trolls have. It plays a role in the trolls' reproductive cycle, just as it does for humans. This is pretty obvious! Not much more needs to be said about this. Moving right along. When a pair of adversaries delve into this quadrant, they become each other's KISMESIS. As one of the concupiscent quadrants, it plays a role in procreation as well. There is no particularly good human translation for this concept. The closest would be an especially potent arch-rivalry. For instance, human players would never be able to adequately diagnose the relationship between the queen and her archagent. But troll players could immediately place it as a dead ringer for kismesissitude. They would think we were all pretty stupid for not getting it. And they would be right. Trolls have a complicated reproductive cycle. It's probably best not to examine it in much detail. The need to seek out concupiscent partners comes with more urgency than typical reproductive instincts. When the IMPERIAL DRONE comes knocking, you had better be able to supply genetic material to each of his FILIAL PAILS. If you have nothing to offer, he will kill you without hesitation. The genetic material - WITHOUT GOING INTO MUCH DETAIL - is a combinative genetic mix from the matesprit and kismesis pairs, respectively. The pails are all offered to the mother grub, who can only receive such precombined material. She then combines all of it into one incestuous slurry, and begins her brooding. This doesn't mean the initial combination was for naught, however. In the slurry, more dominant genes rise to the fore, while the more recessive find less representation in the brood. Especially strong matesprit and kismesis pairings yield more dominant genetic material. The more powerful the complement"

          "content": "or potent the rivalry, the more dominant the genes. TROLL REPRODUCTION SURE IS WEIRD. We all take a moment to lament how pedestrian the human reproductive system is, and further lament that the phrase \"incestuous slurry\" is not a feature of common parlance in human civilization. This quadrant involves a particular type of three-way relationship of a black romantic nature. Falling on the conciliatory side, it has no bearing on the reproductive cycle, except for indirect ramifications. When two trolls are locked in a feud or some otherwise contentious relationship, one can intervene and become their AUSPISTICE. The auspistice mediates between the two, playing the role of a peace keeper, preventing the feud from boiling over into a fully caliginous rivalry. Since such lesser feuds are quite common among trolls, there is a significant need for auspisticing parties. Without them, too many ashen feuds would become caliginous, and begin to conflict with other exclusive kismesis relationships, leading to a great deal of social complexity and sore feelings (even more so than black romance usually involves). Without auspisticism, the result would be widespread black infidelity. The relationships each quadrant describes tend to be malleable, if not volatile, especially on the concupiscent half where more torrid emotions reside. It doesn't take much to flip a switch and transmute blackrom feelings to redrom, and vice versa. In many cases, one party will have red feelings while the other has black. But it will often be the case that one party's feelings will swap to match the other's, since there is no quadrant which naturally accommodates such a disparity. But thereafter, it's not uncommon for the two to toggle between red and black in unison now and then. These scenarios naturally result in both red and black infidelities. This sort of relationship volatility is why conciliatory relationships are an important part of troll romance. An auspistice can stabilize particularly turbulent relationships. If the auspistice fails to mediate properly, or has no interest in the role, or perhaps has different romantic intentions him/herself altogether, then the relationship often quickly deteriorates into one of an especially hostile and torrid nature. There are many outside factors and influences tugging and pulling these relationships in different directions, and unlike humans who have very orderly, simple, straightforward romantic relationships without exception, trolls exist in a state of almost perpetual confusion and generally have no idea what the hell is going on. Being confused by troll relationships is one thing we do have in common though. This quadrant presides over MOIRALLEGIENCE, the other conciliatory relationship. A reasonable human translation would be the concept of a soul mate, but in a more platonic sense, and with a more specific social purpose. Trolls are a very angry and violent race. Some are more hot-tempered and dangerous than others, to the extent that if left to their own devices, they would present a serious threat to society, or even to themselves. Such trolls will have an instinctive pale attraction to a more even-tempered troll, who may become their MOIRAIL. The moirail is obliged to pacify the other, to function as the better half. The two partners in a strong pale relationship will serve to balance and complement each other's emotional profiles, and thus allow their other relationships to be more successful. It's often ambiguous especially among young trolls whether a bond formed between an acquaintance is true moirallegence, or the usual variety of platonic involvement. Furthermore, romantic intentions of a more flushed nature can often be mistaken for paler leanings, much to the frustration of the suitor. But some pale pairings, as the one above, will be strikingly obvious to all who know them. God you just can't get enough of this can you! That would have been a great point for a transition out of this illustrated sociological study, but ok, if you insist. Now see, what's going on here is... It's perfectly simple. When the full matrix of troll romance is in action, we have... uh... Hey, why don't you figure it out! You should be an expert on all this by now anyway. Later our troll hero would try to explain this to our human hero, attempting to convey all the nuance of troll romance through a nearly verbatim recitation of the preceding excerpts. He would try to describe how rich and textured the troll romantic comedies were compared to the one dimensional schlock of our human cinematic counterparts. He would barely scratch the surface of Troll Will Smith's virtuosity with the delicate lattice of troll romance, as he would assist the bumbling fudgeblooded Troll Kevin James through the interwoven minefield-briarpatch of redrom and blackrom entanglements, all the while sifting through his own prickly romantic situation and ultimately learning the true meaning of hate and pity. But would they succeed before the imperial drone came knocking with his thirsty pails at the ready??? Yes, they would. But John didn't understand any of this because he's a moron, and he wouldn't shut up about his awful bullshit Earth movies. He would just go on and on and on about that garbage. But if there was one theme to be hammered through his thick skull, it would be the trolls' cultural preoccupation with romantic destiny. Yes, the romantic landscape is rife with false starts and miscues and infidelities, red and black. But every troll believes strongly that each quadrant holds one and only one true pairing for them, and it is just a matter of time before the grid is filled with auspicious matchups through the mysterious channels of TROLL SERENDIPITY. In short, their belief is that for each quadrant there exists a pair or triad of trolls somewhere in the cosmos that were... MADE FOR EACH OTHER."

Mainly because it was the first venue that allowed for more than just two people to talk to each other at once. The result is the feeling of a messy chat room, rather than a direct message conversation. Except even messier, because this is where the characters begin to play around with the feature that lets them talk to each other across different points on the timeline. The net result of this, mostly, is just Karkat creating an almost infinite supply of new, self-fulfilling ways of owning himself in front of all his friends. This device was a great device to throw into the mix of later Act 5 action. Many good things were done with it, and it really shook the story out of some overly comfortable patterns of character interplay. I give it five stars. I mean, I give everything I do five stars. But this time, I give five stars to this particular five-star rating.\n\nLet's sift through the temporal structure here. Equius is currently reading this memo, which Karkat started six hours ago. This means that when Equius talks, he's the only one referred to as \"current\" (CCT). Everyone else here is some past version of themselves (PCG, PGC, PTA), even those who replied in the recent past, like Sollux did a half hour ago. Later, a future Karkat relative to Equius (FCG) chimes in from all the way toward the end of the session to remark on how embarrassing this all is. This is how all memos work, a complete quagmire of people scattered across the timeline tripping over each other, arguing, and complaining about how stupid the entire bulletin board is. It's a microcosm of Karkat's later trolling efforts of the humans, or at least a decent accidental beta test of the idea. Something he starts out with certain intentions for and tries to do in an organized way, but it completely backfires and devolves into pure chaos he has no control over, in an endless feedback loop of gratuitous self-owns.\n\nFive hours from when Karkat types this, he's looking at dead Sollux on his monitor and probably remembering this memo exchange. Which, according to the laws of sadstuck, just makes the death all the more tragic. He thought Sollux was joking, then blocked him. Karkat seems to have a habit of doing this. Recall that he did basically the same thing when Tavros messaged him to tell him he was just paralyzed. There's kind of a sad conflict in Karkat's personality, where he genuinely cares deeply for all his friends but is so busy and so caught up in his own bullshit all the time that he obliviously glides right over the moments where they're actually in serious trouble.\n\nFCG's message from 612 hours in the future is the first data point that gives us a good sense of the span of the session length. We don't know that's the end of the session from this memo yet—that confirmation comes a bit later—but this at least gives us a sense of what the players are in for. Another odd rule of these memos is that, apparently, before you actually contribute to one you can scroll through the entire thing and read it, beginning to end, including all the messages made deep in the future. So someone who wasn't impatient like Karkat could actually take time to study it, understand everything that's going to happen, and then jump back into the discussion at certain predestined moments they've already read. But the moment you contribute, you sort of collapse the memo's waveform so to speak—you can't read anything after that and just have to fly blind like in an ordinary conversation. Naturally, Karkat gives the memo a half-assed skim before diving into composing it from the start with his blustering nonsense. Does this make perfect sense? Is it scientifically and logically AIRTIGHT? well, maybe not. But it does lead to a lot of funny conversations.\n\nEquius says \"here in the future, this bulletin has come to be regarded as something of a joke,\" even though he's only six hours into Karkat's future while reading this. I guess a born snob will use literally any point of superiority to be snobby with. Blood color, being a few hours in the future, whatever. His observation is worth a laugh, but really, what he probably means is, he scrolled way ahead to see the future of the memo and has observed how many people in the memo mock him for it. He's already identifying more with people from weeks ahead in the timeline than with Karkat, who's only a few hours behind, just for the sake of giving him a hard time. In fact, even Karkat starts doing this to himself. Maybe more than anyone else.\n"

Karkat first, then Terezi, so they're the lowest (so low, they're below the edge of the window). From Karkat's (CCG's) current frame of reference, everyone but Sollux, Eridan, and Feferi have entered. I can ALMOST guarantee that all of those bar heights were carefully considered so as not to produce continuity snags. I remember making these little memo Trollian diagrams as if the slightest error by even a pixel width was an unconscionable act of carelessness. The character dot-markers are all pretty well-placed too. Shouldn't I be winning some sort of award for this shit? The award they give guys who discover the most innovative and perplexing ways to waste their time. That's the one I want, give it to me.\n\nKarkat seems genuinely sympathetic and regretful that this is neither the time nor place to bro out with Eridan over his romantic problems. He truly enjoys hashing such things out and being there for his friends when they have quadrant issues. This is one reason why it's almost impossible to dislike him, even though he's constantly shouting and practically never stops talking. Even Vriska can't help but like him. She logs in from way in the future here basically just to offer some expressions of endearment, in her way. The demeanor that many of his friends have toward him almost makes it seem like they regard him as sort of a cute pet.\n\nListen. That just HAPPENED to be the three letter abbreviation for Future arachnidsGrip, okay? It's not like I specifically went out of my way to make this word appear on this page a whole bunch of times. Karkat simply offers some metacommentary on the word, because it kind of jumps out, doesn't it? What, are you going to sit there and tell me that you would have made the choice not to bring anyone's attention to it at ALL? Oh, what's that you say, smart guy? You probably wouldn't have even made Homestuck in the first place? Well aren't YOU special then. Anyway, Karkat wraps it up with some words to live by: \"OK I'M RAMBLING HERE, I'M AWARE OF THAT.\" I'm copying this statement here as a reminder to get these words tattooed on myself some day.\n\nKarkat's memos start out as attempts to bring order and regimentation to their \"strategy\" as guided by the \"leader\" of the party, which nobody takes seriously at all, and they quickly devolve into forums for romantic counseling, stupid bickering, and friendship bonding. In other words, a smaller sketch of Karkat's arc in totality. Another good thing about memos is that, since literally anyone can jump in from any point in the timeline, there are all these moments in Hivebent we've already seen that these responses can reference, adding a little more dimension to some of those moments. For instance, we really had no idea that after Vriska kissed Tavros, he spent the next ten minutes or so lying on the floor while texting Karkat for romantic advice, in a chat environment that Vriska herself is also privy to. This is a big reason why the memos are good, and more generally speaking, why including what I'm gonna call \"conversational time travel\" is a really interesting and dynamic device for telling stories and drafting comedic scenarios. Consider, after just a couple memos, how much potential they have displayed already? The mind reels imagining all the things you can do in fiction with such a dialogue format.\n\nKarkat is far from being a master of time. If anything, he may actually be sort of a numbskull with regard to the aspect. But since he's charging blindly into this mad quest which by its nature involves so many time shenanigans, it kind of forces him to be introspective and sometimes actually a bit insightful about the nature of time. He has to think about what the future really means. It's \"kind of a wide open thing,\" happening in a few years or a few minutes. When you start seeing future versions of other people and yourself as legitimately different, discretely isolated personas, it conjures certain philosophical problems, which he's constantly grappling with. The further the future is from the present, the more distinct that separate version of a person is. Ideas like this, and Karkat's unabashed floundering with them, start threading into bigger themes of the story, such as, what is a person, and what constitutes the \"self\"? Is it an ideal? A composite of ideals? The result of a composite of ideals and a set of specific choices? Clearer understanding of a single aspect, Time, actually starts deepening one's understanding of the concept of self. Does greater understanding of other aspects allow this as well? The story answers this later on.\n\nI wonder what Future Karkat specifically found so nauseating about this memo in particular? Seems like Vriska and Tavros had something bordering on a constructive conversation here. He's likely just reacting with disgust to his own contributions. This is like a guy who, during a bout of depression, scrolls through old chatlogs or emails and beats himself up about them. It's a fair read on Karkat's character if you want to say he suffers from depression. But then, so many of these kids do, don't they? The condition of being young and growing up is an inherently depressive undertaking, hence why so much of Homestuck is the way it is. Depression is really common, and I don't think you can swing a dead cat without smacking someone who is currently or has at some point suffered some form of it. Maybe the largely and almost universally depressive journey from childhood to adulthood sets people up for patterns of negative expectation for the rest of their lived reality, which then keep playing themselves out. And so it goes, the specter of depression seeming to haunt people for all time to come. I don't know, this ain't clinical, and I'm no sadness doctor. I'm just another schlub ruminating on what it means to be a person, using a crude website as a scratch pad for such reverie. Maybe I'll finally figure it all out by the time I write the Final Author Note for these books. I'll let you know if I do.\n"

It probably felt not worth shoehorning in a precise one-to-one correlation where HB would help his kid with redrom, SS with blackrom, etc. Their influence is looser than that. SS goes on about how much he hates all these kids, and CD tries to be vaguely conciliatory toward Sollux. Close enough."

This just sounds like the tagline for the result of the 2016 U.S. election.\n\nWhen Current Karkat actually starts arguing with Current Karkat, not only did he not notice he was doing it, I think it's safe to say that even we didn't notice he was doing it. A lot of arguments he has with other versions of himself are hard to differentiate, because it's always gray text, and it's always yelling. It blurs together. Much later, he \"solves\" this problem by switching to red for a bit, during one of his more pathetic conversational loops of self-hate. A little further down he starts wondering what they did wrong in the session. Which, as I was saying earlier, is not really anything, and he kind of almost has that epiphany here. But then loses that epiphany once he discovers the humans, decides to hate them with a refreshed sense of rage, and starts blaming all the wrong things again for their failure, including himself. It's almost like he gains clarity in his rage gaps. When one fog of rage subsides, he starts seeing things clearly, but that all goes away the moment he enters a new fog of rage. Regardless, we're getting close to the end of Hivebent now, and you can kind of start sensing this wildly fractured, manic narrative start to gather itself and point itself back in the direction of where we left off. The new hate-hobby Karkat discovers, of course, we know to be the humans.\n\nThis is also the first time in Hivebent when we spend any real time tuning into a part that takes place on the meteor they end up stranded on after whatever catastrophe causes them to flee there. For all the zipping up and down the timeline we do, we never actually go that far until now. Again, it's about starting to gather up and organize all these loose threads and direct them back into something we recognize as connecting to the main narrative line. Even when certain stories or arcs are really chaotic and wildly out of order, I think most of us have good intuitions when it comes to picking up on when a story is making moves in preparation for the approach to its own endgame material. This memo starts feeling like that turning point. You've also got Kanaya weighing in, playing the role of a sort of wise, sympathetic ear to a down-and-out protagonist. You know That Moment in the movie. We all do. We're all experts. Homestuck knows you're a media expert and uses that assumption to its \"advantage\" all the time. The only time it backfires is when it turns out you're nowhere near the expert I thought you were. You know those moments when you see me shaking my head in grave disappointment? That's why I'm doing that, FYI.\n\nKarkat suggests Aradia isn't a great Maid of Time. I dunno about that. She time traveled to make a thousand doomed robotic copies of herself to help defeat a crazy-strong Black King. Seems pretty good to me. He's probably remarking more on her mental stability than her competence. Of course what's really going on here, story-wise, is that he's foreshadowing her violent freakout in the End-of-Hivebent animation coming up soon.\n\nKarkat mentions here an \"invisible riddler.\" This is an idea that comes up from time to time throughout the story. Recall the \"unseen riddler\" in the narration during John's early animation, when he's listening to the wind in his neighborhood. It conjures the idea of a hidden Loki-like figure somewhere, whose pranks have nihilistic designs, an intangible force of mischief that robs its targets of a meaningful or dignified existence. In John's case, the nihilistic rumination about this figure seems to focus on the shapeless and uncertain direction of his life. Karkat's remark here focuses on the futility and self-fulfillment of one's own foolishness, passively allowed to play itself out by this prankster figure, who he links to \"Father Time\" as well. There is no one true god of Paradox Space, but to whatever extent there is, it's probably this riddler figure, which is why it's left in doubt as to whether he even exists at all. He's never discussed without also referencing his invisibility, or dubious reality. A much less cagey explanation is, it's probably best interpreted as the forces of mischief and authorial cruelty or callousness toward the subjects within this fiction, which are laced into the entire narrative and relate closely to the quality of \"authorial scorn\" that was mentioned earlier in some of the Vriska meta. When galvanized through more extreme figures like Caliborn, these forces become less passively nihilistic and prankstery, and more actively hostile and destructive.\n\nThat Kanaya has trouble imagining how Karkat could have a strong handle on the subject of romance without access to an online manual (like her access to Rose's walkthrough) says something about the way she thinks, and views skill or expertise. Here she says romance and psychology aren't her strong suits, and a couple pages ago she was expressing doubts about her role as a Space player. Some characters struggle with self-loathing issues (she's talking to one of them now), but she seems especially troubled by self-doubt issues. Maybe this is why these two resonate as friends so well. One is there to reassure him he is not loathsome, the other to reassure her she is not incompetent. We've been over Kanaya's role as a mother figure to a bunch of people, and it helps for a good mother figure to have a good son figure as a counterpoint, a son who's there to remind her, \"No, you're not bad at this. Stop it with that talk.\"\n\nKarkat's dissertation on magic is a pretty good summary of the ongoing tension between the realness/fakeness attribute of magic throughout the story. We get pretty flippant about magic in Homestuck, don't we? It's just a word you can use to describe certain forces, in the same way that you can use the word \"luck\" to evaluate certain outcomes, if you're fixated on that concept. This isn't really mind-blowing wisdom here. I'd describe it more as premise-level information, upon which the story elaborates in certain ways. Magic and luck are more like states of mind. If there is any deeper truth to sift from these semantics, it's an idea that the story keeps returning to, which is that the power of belief is the key to everything. Believing in things reduces their fakeness attribute. It's the force that shapes your reality, used to snatch personal meaning from the jaws of a cynical and nihilistic environment. Could this be why Hope is framed as the most fundamentally powerful aspect? Even the other aspects themselves are ideas like this (recall: luck=light), whose power is subject to the ebb and flow of one's belief in them. And belief itself isn't necessarily just a trick of willpower. It can be an expression of one's willingness to embrace an idea, or pursue a deeper understanding of it.\n\nObviously Karkat is reacting to the moment Kanaya saws off Tavros's legs, while Equius watches creepily. We saw one frame of that earlier. Yes, it's a funny beat in the conversation that calls back to that moment, but it also establishes an important hour of missing time for Karkat while he's passed out. This gap where he's asleep on the floor comes up again later in Act 5. The second part of Act 5 does a lot of what Hivebent does. Where Hivebent skips around, chaotically fitting together the greater puzzle of the troll session until we finally reach the end, A5A2 skips around a lot, fitting together the puzzle of their stay on the meteor and sorting through the mystery of exactly what happens and when. So there starts to be an accounting of many little moments like this, to use as points of reference for when certain things are happening. \"Aradiabot explodes\" is another such benchmark for the reader to use to track surrounding events. Interestingly (maybe), Karkat uses this idea too, by setting \"Jade's dreambot explodes\" as a similar benchmark to help Jade get her bearings through a nonlinear swamp of communications.\n"

The Rift is just a term Karkat used to describe an event he didn't understand, which was Jack showing up and slicing their entryway into the new universe in half. He guessed some vaque rift in space-time was responsible for that. The jagged rip in the timeline window is something else completely. If you read Problem Sleuth, that rip might look familiar. The underlying graphic and style of that jagged edge were copied from the moment when the entire universe ripped in half, and then needed to be sewn back together with a big needle.

That is, his blood color being one of the ridiculously worst-kept secrets possible, even as he insists to himself that it's unhackably privileged information, even around someone who he knows operates via some kind of powerful \"scent sonar.\"\n\nKarezi is one of those baseline type of ships that exist in any given franchise. The kind with blinking arrows pointing to it and a neon sign saying \"THE TEXT INTENDS FOR YOU TO SHIP THESE TWO.\" It has endgame written all over it. Which, despite some endearing qualities and some decent conversations in service to the idea, is what makes it a bit boring. To whatever extent Homestuck is capable of serving up a conventional, recognizable morsel of \"fairytale intent\" on a platter, this might be it. A statement expressing what it considers to be its equivalent to the boy-meets-girl, written-in-the-stars, journey-to-the-white-picket-fence sort of pairing. Which is not an inherently bad thing. There's a always place for arcs like these, and a certain comfort people take from grabbing on to the white-picket-fence outcomes and rooting for them. A lot of people were pretty stoked about Karezi. Stuff like this conversation obviously is going to start shoveling coal into that engine pretty hard. But these features are what give it a predictable quality, and thus make it much less likely to be fully realized in the long run. Instead, later it's given more value as a foil relationship, a thing that threatens to happen often, because it's \"supposed\" to, but functions as a basis for turbulent departures. A backdrop of stable, comprehensible relationship potential against which some more unpredictable and challenging outcomes for them both start to play out.\n\nQuick off-topic note: Karkat's reference to the forty-eight signs is based on the (fake) forty-eight-player Squiddle session that apocryphally created their universe. Back on topic: Karezi as the male/female lead, meant-to-be sort of ship, is, well, it's obvious. It's obvious to me at least, because I'm dangling it out there, obviously. Therefore I feel it must be obvious to you. And as such, I feel you must know I see it as obvious, and intend it as obvious, in this big feedback loop of self-evidentiary storycraft and trope jockeying. Any time this is true, I think awareness of the circumstance tends to leak into the consciousness of the characters involved. Characters in HS tend to be pretty self-aware (like Striders and Lalondes), but even the ones that aren't as much like these two) still tend to carry a form of subconscious selfawareness. (Feel free to chew on this oxymoron for a moment before continuing.) In other words, on some level, Karkat and Terezi both just sort of know they are the male and female leads in a lengthy heroic tale, and thus their sense of this propels them toward attraction, as if satisfying unspoken narrative obligation. This must especially seem true for Karkat, who lives and breathes the tropes of his romance films."

I'm still plowing through the meta on WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH KAREZI? It feels important to hit these subjects very hard down here in the gutter while I've got the chance, just so I don't have to later. Then you know what's basically up with Karezi, forever, and I can opine on other matters with foregone presumption of your understanding. Unless you forget I said all this, which you probably will. And frankly, so will I. Anyway. I think the fact that on some unwitting level, they both recognize a part of their attraction is based on obligatory service to the narrative pushing them together like this goes a long way in explaining the fact that the pairing is a bit tense, full of fraught turns, false starts, and stupid miscues. It follows a clumsy path, and a lot of this feels like it stems from the fact that Karkat ends up forcing it along the way, much the way he does with his role as \"the leader,\" which is also a role thrust upon him by unseen narrative forces. He keeps pushing for the romance to happen aggressively and obsessively, because he senses that's what's \"supposed\" to happen and never actually has the epiphany that this is what's going on in his mind. And Terezi keeps getting caught in the cycle of stupidity too for similar reasons, and can't seem to stop humoring the development of this inorganically blossoming romance. Which exacerbates her depression issues, makes things worse, and ultimately contributes to her deep dive through the clownlust sewer.\n\nBut that said, all long-road Karezi bummers aside, at least at this moment in the story this thing they have going on here reads as pretty endearing. Like there could still be real promise to whatever's going on here. Could it have worked out nice and fine if Karezi followed a conventionally successful romantic path, and turned out to be endgame as hell? Sure, why not. But it didn't. All I can tell you is, a lot of people went nuts for that little heart he logged back on to share. I wonder how many of those people gradually transmuted into Davekat stans? We may never know."

It was more like me saying, \"Yo guys, chill here for a bit while I take a moment to handle a multiyear spanning crisis.\" Usually those long gaps were radically overcompensated for by killing all the characters in one fell swoop upon my return and dumping a ton of horribly drawn anime on everyone.

          "content": "[S] Make her pay is the culmination of Hivebent. It ties up what can be regarded as the few remaining loose ends in a rough and bloody collage of retributional actions, which all revolve around the brand-new star of the story, Vriska. This sounds like a joke, but it really isn't. If there's one thing we end up with at the end of Hivebent that we didn't begin with, it's the emergence of this figure as someone who's going to demand center stage from now on, and who won't take no for an answer, no matter how many times the narrative tries to point the camera at something else. This animation really couldn't do a better job of signaling this transition, since the apex of Hivebent revolves around not just one of Vriska's plot points, but two. One where she does something horrible, and another where she suffers horrible consequences for what she did.\n\nAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! Sorry, I lose my shit whenever I see that wolf head. The animation picks up right where we left off, when Scratch blew off Vriska's arm and took out her eye. Have we talked about this particular disfigurement yet? It's mentioned in the Pupa Pan parallels, but also it's the same disfigurement Jack receives in the other session, as a result of some mishaps with the clown doll John prototyped. Is this a \"cursed disfigurement\"? Is the fact that this happened to Vriska, as sort of a punishment by Scratch, meant to indicate that future realities would be cursed with echoes of this disfigurement as well? Did Scratch give her this disfigurement deliberately because he knew of its future relevance? Is it simple foreshadowing? Is there no correlation? What are the answers, when you can't definitively tell if one event takes place before another, or the reverse is true? Are these disfigurements taking place in a way that each is circumstantially simultaneous with the other? Scratch would probably say yes. The reason I know he would is because he's basically just a slightly more obnoxious and opaque version of the author.\n\nThe animation settles into a rhythm from here on, in a way that I think is pretty self-explanatory, even in static form. So there's probably not much to say about it. I think I'm going to try a brand-new trick. It's called \"hiding the author notes margin\" when I don't have anything particularly worthwhile to say. Oh, you don't think that sounds like the \"coolest\" idea I've ever had? Well, why don't you give it a shot first, see how you feel about it. I know I'm feeling pretty great about the plan already.\n\n[Editor's note: highly irrelevant to anything in the flash, but I'm leaving this one in anyway] The author note margin suddenly returns on page 420, just in time for me to invite you to \"blaze it.\" It's totally fine with me if you want to rip this page out of the book and roll a dank blunt with it. I won't call the cops. What? You think returning to writing page notes just to say this was actually dumb as shit? Fine, DONT blaze it. I'll try to do better, by sharing an urban legend with you, that I made up one time. If the clock strikes 4:13, you can say \"Homestuck\" out loud, if you want. But if you do, you will then have exactly seven minutes to smoke some weed. If you don't manage to do this before the clock strikes 4:20, I will show up and murder you. Don't tell any of your friends this, it will end in tragedy.\n\nIf it wasn't totally clear, here's what Vriska did. She psychically controls Tavros, who's a total chump and is easy for her to control at any time, for any purpose. She makes him use his psychic powers to commune with an animal. The animal in question is Terezi's pre-hatched dragon, who is psychically linked to Terezi, who is asleep. The dragon then controls Terezi to get up, sleepwalk through the woods, and stare directly into the harsh Alternian sun until she goes blind. Pretty good revenge, Vriska. I'm impressed. Or I would be, if I wasn't the one who thought of it instead of you. Oh wait, that just makes me even more impressed with it. Good job all around, everyone. Me and my OCs make a great team.\n\nGetting contributions from other artists for animations was still kind of a new idea at this point. But the Flashes were still made with blazing speed, so the contributing artists had to work fast too, which resulted in a looser-looking art style similar to what I was working in. Still, opening it up to other artists who could invest more time individually into certain pieces really expanded the potential for how good some of these assets could look. So eventually some really strong examples started showing up, like this one. Making productions this way really widened the range of what Homestuck was capable of looking like. That range is about as broad as it gets, stretching from \"complete and utter shit\" all the way to \"commercially produced, mainstream animation studio-grade.\" That escalation finally caps off with the Act 7 animation, which, for whatever else it might be, is the ultimate synthesis of Homestuck as a wildly escalating medium in the visuals department.\n\nThe neat thing here is that, though Vriska believes she's getting revenge, the dragon is actually managing to turn this into a boon for Terezi. Terezi hinted at this earlier in a conversation with Vriska, wanting to thank her for this moment, which Vriska didn't understand and just got frustrated about. The dragon is actually making her sleepwalk in two places: in the forest, and on Prospit. The animation sort of stylistically blends these two processions, toggling and fading between Terezi's real self and dream self as they stroll along.\n\nThey open their eyes in both places. Dream Terezi sees Skaia, real Terezi gets an eyeful of burning sun. This is what causes Terezi to wake up on Prospit. She's blind in both the real and dream worlds, but now that her dragon is in tune with her mind, she's taught how to see in other ways, making most use of those lessons on Prospit. By the time she wakes up back in the woods to discover herself blind, she can already \"see\" well enough to find her way back home. Her blinding isn't really the maiming Vriska was going for. It's a sense-expanding, mind-awakening event that Terezi feels improves her life, and it becomes an important part of her identity. So much so that to be \"healed\" would trigger a crisis of identity and depression.\n\nThere are a few little sprite-based battle vignettes sprinkled into the animation. Full disclosure? Stuff like this tended to be filler. Some of these songs were LONG. But I didn't want to cut them down too often. A lot of times it was hard to find meaningful ways to fill every single stretch of a song without just dropping some reasonably cool, reasonably on-topic moments to grab the eye, or to use on a transitional basis before moving on to another stretch of the song that marked the right time to start a more relevant cinematic sequence.\n\nThe way the art contributors worked as a group usually was pretty open-ended. A little in advance of starting an animation I'd say something like, \"I don't really know exactly what this Flash needs yet, but probably just a bunch of generally cool battle stuff, like sprites and backgrounds, would be useful.\" And they did turn out to be useful. I almost always found a way to sneak everything in there, even if it was only onscreen for a couple seconds. It's one reason why a lot of these sequences end up being so dense.\n\nA first glimpse of the Sollux vs. Eridan drama. A lot of these brief clips imply events that readers easily could have guessed were going to play out anyway. We knew Sollux and Feferi started dating. We knew Feferi was Eridan's ex, and we knew what his attitude was like. We don't even need to make a whole thing about it. The wrong play would have been adding another scene in Hivebent where Eridan was like YOU STOLE MY GILFROND YOU SCURVVY SCALAWWAG! All we need is this brief shot, and it's like, oh, yep, there they go, that figures. Sometimes these arcs include so much shit, it seems like maybe there's no real vetting process for which scenes and conversations go in and which don't? That ain't true at all. There's a real art to determining out of all this chaos what's worth showing, which conversations are worth printing, and which ones are best left implied or omitted entirely. I can't give you the guidebook to such decisions. Ya just gotta FEEL IT.\n\nProps to Vriska's Megaman slide across the bridge. Again, this only exists here because one of the artists randomly decided to make that pose.\n\nAradiabot shows up to beat Vriska's ass down. And we see she's got two portable, floating time-travel devices, like Dave has. These are implied to be akin to his turntables, but they're made from the stuff she had available on her planet. So this shot establishes that she's been making the rounds through time. Doing what, though? We'll see. But whatever she did, it seems like she's done enough of it to decide it's squared away, and she's now at liberty to focus on settling an old score.\n\nThis all gets pretty savage. Probably the worst the story's presented so far, on a graphic-violence basis. Any time Homestuck moves the line a little further along any axis, it's basically saying, \"This is also something the story can be.\" That goes for everything from the quality of rendering to the nature of the content. This fight pushes the line on Homestuck's capacity for brutality a little further. In that regard, this animation acts as another good transitional piece, paving the way for the tone of the rest of this Act. The Nastytimes are upon us.\n\nWhen Aradia said, \"Hey you wanna hit the boardwalk a little later?\" I don't think this is what Vriska thought she had in mind.\n\nCue chorus from the \"why the fuck does Tavros have long sleeves\" choir. Good question. This is just one of the perils of having a bunch of artists working on this stuff quickly, without much time taken to vet all the assets for consistency. Is it really too far outside the realm of possibility he's got a black hoodie stowed away somewhere in that rocket chair?\n\nI'd like to imagine she delivered an ice-cold one-liner before vanishing. Maybe something like, \"Thanks for the present.\"\n\nAnd we see this is the story of how Vriska awakened on Prospit too. You can look at the animation as telling as two parallel tales, in two different ways. Either as two tales of revenge revolving around Vriska, one where she delivers retribution and the other where she receives it. Or as two tales of awakening, one where Terezi wakes up in response to making the best of a punishment she probably didn't deserve, and the other where Vriska wakes up in response to being jolted from slumber by a punishment she probably did deserve.\nThis is a funny and abrupt way to end this sequence. Sort of a nice, long-awaited reunion on Prospit, after the final score has been \"formally evened.\" It probably results in a short conversation we don't get to see that is apologetic and conciliatory in nature. Maybe one of those rare moments, pre-retcon, where they just get to be good friends for a bit, unfettered by all the baggage, bad blood, and competitive bullshit. Unfortunately, this moment doesn't last long. Vriska's real body starts slowly bleeding to death, while she tries to convince Tavros to finish her off in her quest cocoon. Her dream self starts bleeding horribly too, to match the damage to the real body, in keeping with the \"time limit\" a player's dream self has before they can no longer be kissed back to life. Terezi watches her start to bleed here, and I'm going to guess she finds it a bit disturbing to witness.\n\nAnother observation: Vriska's dream self is healed, arm and eye intact. Terezi's is still blind though. There are some vague and unspoken rules concerning whether serious injuries transfer over to dream selves. A decent way of viewing a dream self is just as a dream-projection of the id. A collection of certain ideas about yourself, your identity. Vriska's injuries aren't an important part of who she is, and if they were healed, she'd be glad to be done with them. Terezi's blindness is a big part of her identity. In fact, she was blinded by the very process of her awakening, which, if you ask me, is a more than logical way of understanding how the injury was imprinted on her dream self for good.\n"

Pretty convenient, huh. Once the king is defeated, this same lily pad changes color and serves as the platform for the gateway to claim the reward. See the panel on the right. This platform serves as the environment for a lot of endgame material toward the close of the story.

It's not relevant, it's not the focus, and the battles of the story almost never are. It's helping solidify the ongoing precedent that endgame battles really are not what Homestuck does. I've said things like that outside the story, and included many reminders of it within. The supreme example of this, of course, is the alleged endgame battle that is theoretically supposed to take place with Lord English. Conventional expectations lead to presumptions on the reader's part that the narrative is structured that way, and what it must be building up to. This is a rather substantial point of analysis, probably best left for closer to that moment. But navigating around certain big battles and confrontations relates to some themes I've bandied about freely in this book. That, in short, the \"real story\" we've been trained to look for and expect in such media isn't actually the \"real story\" of Homestuck. It's an imagined narrative that happens in the background while the stuff we're most concerned with takes place on an extra-narrative layer with a set of completely different focal points and objectives, and only uses the backdrop traditional-narrative layer as substance for deconstruction, satire, and subversion of expectations, and as a basis for the parallels it draws between the regimentations within narrative and real life, which exist to challenge those forced to grow up in either environment."

If you know the story well, I think her mistake is actually pretty obvious. She's conflating a rift with a scratch, when in fact they are different things. First of all, a rift isn't really anything. It's just a word the trolls use to describe Jack's sudden appearance, the act of teleporting from an exile station into a session. A scratch is something totally different, and is a much bigger deal. It really is a prescribed action you can take in a game, under extreme circumstances. It's basically a reset. If you get in a jam, you can reset the game, or actually, your entire universe's starting conditions, wiping out everything, including your current forms and all those in the session. The scratch indirectly led to the rift, because all Jack was doing was trying to flee the session before the reset, and he wound up on Earth, and he had to flee from there too, because the universe was about to be destroyed. And the destruction of the universe(s) is yet another term Aradia's been using, called the Great Undoing, which really is what we're seeing when we look at that garbled stuff in her Trollian terminal there.\n"

(This also relates to Dave's shades, which have been cosmically imprinted with stars and galaxies as well, a feature that traces back to their original appearance in Problem Sleuth, believe it or not). It felt important to visually link the two universes to these two colors, so that they could be signified with such simple visual associations in the future. This becomes useful later in the story. There are some pretty abstract ideas to convey, involving entire universes, specifically the destruction thereof. For instance, the Tumor, a huge bomb, has two explosive components: a big blue tube and a big red tube. Both of these are meant to signal that in some abstract way that they \"contain\" these universes, and when both universes are destroyed in one circumstantially simultaneous event, then the entire bomb detonates. Stuff like this would be pretty challenging to communicate without the use of these color-coding methods.

Later Sollux is only half-blind, because due to an overexertion to save everyone he ends up half-dead. (Why yes, you're right, this is kind of a stupid fact, but whatever). Which matches up with the fact that later, due to the scratch resulting in the Alpha Kid timeline, the human universe appears to have renewed life. Note that this does not mean the scratch literally resurrected the big frog Jack murdered. It simply means the post-scratch timeline always existed within that frog somewhere, and when we view the Alpha Kids, we are witnessing moments that took place before the frog was killed.

Time to pull my shit together, splash a glass of cold water on my face, and add some fucking VALUE to this book. I promise I will do my very best to be coherent, articulate, and funny on every single page from now on. Oh, what's that? NOW you start laughing? Here's an idea. I'll start making some remarks about Homestuck, and you can all chill out. Deal? A5A2 opens with a stately, low-key animation reintroducing us to all the plot threads and characters we put on hold for what must have seemed like an eternity but in truth was only a few months of real-time updating. It's a piece conveying narrative integration, a montage of transmission, redirecting the energy just generated by the engine of Hivebent into torque, which then begins turning the wheels of the greater plot. When this animation ends, we finally take our foot off the brake and peel outta here. Since we just took such a long detour, we need little reminders of where we left off, which was [S] Descend. One such reminder is delivered by showing direct evidence that baby John has, in fact, literally murdered his grandmother with the huge joke book he rode down from space after getting shot through a portal during the Reckoning. Perhaps I should add that ending the life of another human being via a vast collection of corny jokes is a proposition I can identify with on a very personal level.\n\nThe old threads we're being reminded of wind into the new threads we just caught up with, by way of reviewing the life and times of John Egbert through the eyes of our new and favorite buddy, Karkat. The old and the new coming together like this lets us know what we're in for over the remainder of Act 5, which by now we can infer is a Whopper Act by previous standards, because we've just been modestly informed that the rest of this act is labeled with an entirely new subdivision called Act 2. Layering acts within acts is a thing that we didn't even know Homestuck could do. But really, we should have known, because Homestuck is always trying to let us know it can do anything it wants, but we just keep not listening. When I do things like drop the label \"Act 5 Act 2\" on readers, maybe it seems like I'm just clowning on you as usual. Maybe it's all a big goof. If you think that, fair. But there's real purpose here. By signaling that this is the beginning of an entirely new act unto itself, yet one still contained within another act, I'm letting you know the remainder of the arc is likely to be substantial. The process of merging two major narrative rivers into one huge river is itself going to be a very substantial narrative undertaking, and the story isn't going to bother pretending otherwise. Fooling around with the story's partitioning system in this whimsical way is actually a direct, totally up-front mechanism for dropping that pretense. It is literally using bullshit in order to stop bullshitting you.\n\nEvery little morsel of John's life, no matter how mundane or foolish, is absorbed by an absolutely captivated Karkat. Every tiny increment of this strange and exciting alien boy's journey through childhood is feeding into Karkat's brewing hatred just a little bit more. We coast through a few endearing moments we hadn't seen before, such as when John met Jade for the first time. As one might expect, it was a simple \"hi im jade! hi i'm john!\" type of transaction that got their friendship rolling. We also get a peek at John's ludicrous Harry Anderson wallpaper. A few weeks before I typed this note, Harry Anderson tragically passed away. R.I.P. to this magician guy who barely anyone knows of, or cares about. We hardly knew ye, or cared about ye.\n\nThe gag here—okay wait, this isn't even a gag, it's serious as hell... Whatever this is, here's what's up with it. Basically, when Karkat discovers John for the first time, when he connects the dots and decides that this is the boy who is directly responsible for all his failures and problems, it's \"hate at first sight.\" Even though this may not be a gag, it does serve as a pretty good punchline of sorts to all the buildup we just went through: getting to know Karkat through a long detour/review of his journey, learning about troll romance and how that system works, etc. Then we finally return to the A-plot, and we see the spades in Karkat's eyes, and...ah, yes. We get it now. This is why Karkat is infatuated with John and spews impotent rage through a clumsy reverse-linear deluge of hate-flirting. In a way, this is something readers can relate to, since we've had a similar experience in following John's journey and growing to love him. But for Karkat, that love transmutes into hate, due to his displaced anger and his culture. It must be very confusing for love and hate to be almost interchangeable emotions. When you add being a stupid teen to the equation, it's no wonder all the trolls are such hot disasters. And now we know all this, and so have valuable context for fully appreciating the A5A2 arc. It only took getting steamrolled by hundreds of pages of Hivebent to enjoy these dividends."

Some of the energy from Hivebent's intense nonlinear storytelling patterns are carrying over to the next sub-act. A5A2 isn't quite as freewheeling as Hivebent in terms of \"show literally anything, from any point on the timeline, literally any time,\" but it jumps around enough to keep things interesting and unpredictable.\n\nThe time-hopping here isn't purely narrative trickery, or me being whimsical by pointing the camera at whatever I want, whenever I want. There's a good in-story reason for scattering nonlinear focal points throughout A5A2. Which is that, unlike in the acts prior to Hivebent, now we have the luxury of seeing events from a troll point of view. And the trolls are all accessing human events through Trollian, which lets them bounce around the human timeline like maniacs. So we get to see what they see sometimes, which isn't necessarily the order in which we would be viewing things if we didn't have their POV at our disposal.\n\nBecause of the intriguing Future John pajama panel, I'm launching into some bigass paragraphs on storycraft. Frankly, since the last book, that's basically what this gutter has been used for. So be it. But in doing so, I'm almost missing the chance to reflect on this really epic screed that Karkat introduces himself to John with, which, as we now know, might as well be a love letter. John says he's not gay. I mean, sure, I guess he technically is \"not a homosexual.\" But aside from that, who are we trying to kid? Everything going on here is really quite spectacularly gay. All of the trolls' involvement with the humans originates from one poorly thought-out, helplessly hate-smitten and gay overture made by a cranky teen boy. Karkat had this whole tirade bottled up inside, ready to unload, but because John is totally expecting it, and already knows Karkat well, he is able to completely disarm, flummox, and redirect all of the hostile energy. The ensuing backwards-chatting idiot spiral is a direct result of John affably and naively sabotaging Karkat's high-strung, breathlessly romantic overture. The lesson is clear: the entire Homestuck universe turns exclusively on the axis of of gay teen follies.\n\nEverything John is saying here, his whole attitude, and lines like \"oh god, the quadrants...\" reflect the fact that he clearly knows considerably more about the trolls than he did when we last saw him. In other words, it's almost like he just got done with the onerous process of reading Hivebent, just like we did. And he probably has about the same take on most of that material as we do. In this story, the characters literally never stop behaving as stand-ins for the readers in various ways. This conversation winds down in the fairly predictable manner we've come to expect from Karkat, with his stubborn commitment to ongoing gestures of self-humiliation and outlandish insults. But then there's a curveball at the end. People really got a kick out of John's final line. But \"soon,\" as we're going to gradually learn, is a pretty relative concept. Sometimes you need a lot of patience when waiting for stuff that's coming soon."

Possibly only second to the time she uses her own blood to write instructions that rewrite the whole story to bring Vriska back to life, or when she preemptively convinces herself to dump Karkat before anything even starts. This whole memo is made primarily to troll Karkat, roast him for his own self-important memos, and provide a fun environment everyone likes better—a nice, easy-going space where they can have a good time and do some roleplaying (which is also meant to own Karkat). Also, he's not allowed to post. Of course, if Terezi really knew what was going on, she wouldn't have to work that hard to own him at all about his plan to troll the humans. She could just keep mercilessly pointing out that the only reason he wants to do it at all is because he has a hate-crush on the nerdy human boy.\n\nEven though the trolls are at the end of their adventure, the attitude of everyone under Karkat's leadership is pretty much the same as it was when they began: much skepticism and ridicule surrounding his orders, with no one particularly inclined to take him all that seriously. Maybe it's because they're just used to acting this way by now. But the deeper reason is that all of Karkat's orders, everything he insists on as being \"urgent,\" revolve around some unwitting need to serve his own objectives rather than something that serves everyone's needs in a clear way. At the beginning, he was desperately trying to pull the team together to play Sgrub, but mainly so he could prove himself as a great leader and a ruthless warrior. Here he's trying to get everyone on board with harassing some alien kids they don't know, basically for some combination of satisfying his own petty grievances and wanting an excuse to hate-crush on John some more. So when everyone's response to his \"plan\" is some variation on \"Dude, this makes no sense at all,\" it's because...it doesn't.\n\nTerezi tells a confused Gamzee from weeks ago to go peruse other memos. Perhaps ones that get started on the meteor in the future? Ones written during more fraught and suspenseful circumstances than this? How much advance reading has Gamzee been doing? How much studying? Planning? Biding his time? Makes you wonder, is all I'm saying. But it doesn't make you wonder too much, because we quickly get distracted by about 500 consecutive lines of Karkat and Terezi banning each other as they fight over the same keyboard. In the last book, I told you we would be reaping great rewards from these memos. I would never lie to you. Not ever, about anything. I would never risk jeopardizing this special bond of trust we have.\n\nThey have a point here. While it's funny to see the results of their keyboard mashing and mutual banning warfare in the form of the resulting memo text, we don't really get to see them do all this. We can only imagine what it looks like. So we also have to picture them typing these entire statements to each other on the same keyboard. And there's no way that can possibly work unless they take turns, where one troll waits patiently while the other is composing a testy remark to the other, right in front of them. It's a completely absurd way to have an argument. It probably also qualifies as another log on the Karezi fire, for those keeping score at home. It's important to keep score of all those logs. That way, you'll know the precise quantity of precious shipping lumber that gets erased from history once I retcon-shitcan their entire relationship off the website."

We needed to cut away and do a huge backstory song and dance just so we could establish the alien setting in which Vriska exists, so we could introduce Vriska and bring her into the story. Then, once all that was said and done, only one question remained, and only one question mattered: How does Vriska fit into all this? What does Vriska think of these human kids? How is she messing with them? That's the important stuff. Even before Hivebent, we could tell already that Karkat was completely useless and full of hot air. But Vriska? Wow. We know a lot about her now. We know she's a striking combination of being extremely dangerous and extremely effective. This should be good, right? Of course it's going to be good.

And since all their correspondence is so mixed up with predestination due to their nonlinear chatting methods, she's basically trapped Paradox Space into making sure she stays important throughout the entire remainder of the human session. We quickly see that her attachment to John starts bordering on obsessive for these reasons. In fact, she hardly ever talks to the other kids and seems to have a noticeable disdain for the very idea of even bothering to interact with them.

It's only a minor refrain though, and as the story goes on, it becomes less about legitimate reunification with his father and more about presenting his father as a figure that keeps receding into the distance, further and further out of John's reach. Which culminates in Dad's death, and visions of his ghost staying tantalizingly beyond John's ability to engage with. The guardians are presented more like parental abstractions than real people, and this partly means they symbolize some idealized form of the parent-child relationship, as well as the previous life that embodies for the kids. Or in other words, they symbolize childhood itself. Abstract, authority figure-like touchstones for the life of innocence the kids can never return to, which only seems to get further away from them whenever they try."

John plays it cool through a lot of adversity and trauma, but his great desire to reunite with his dad shows how much he misses the peaceful life of childhood, and how alarmed he feels by his sudden departure into this life of uncertainty and danger. It's one of his few tells, a window into heavily masked trauma. Even when he finally reunites with his dad in the end, it's not actually his specific dad. It's Jane's peculiar doppeldad. Any dad will do, when Dad himself is an intrinsically nonspecific entity. John's not reuniting with his father in that case, he's reuniting with the IDEA of a father. The idea of a comfort and peace long left behind, which maybe can begin to be restored in some sense through their victory."

She forcefully interrupts a moment that is deeply important and emotional to him, thereby probably denying that opportunity from ever happening again, just so she can insert herself into his life and force him to pay attention to her. Now here she is again, being kind of rude (e.g. calling him stupid), but more than that, being vaguely obsequious overall, which is something about her I was harping on in the last book. Vriska cozies up to certain kinds of people, namely those she wants something from or feels will elevate her status by association. John's the perfect mark for the manipulative, ass-kissing games she plays.\n\nSince we're in the Vriska Zone now and forever, I'll just keep talking about her. It bears more examination of how her manipulation strategy seems to deftly blend ass-kissing and aggression. Successfully manipulative, sociopathically charismatic people tend to have this balance down to a science. The strategy seems to involve controlling the interplay between flattery, appealing to common interests, charming or flirtatious rhetoric, and little jabs, negs, or outright insults to keep the target off-balance. The target gets sort of hooked by the fascinating spectacle, intrigued, and strangely disarmed. Too much flattery results in suspicion, too much negativity is a turn-off (or taken to an extreme like Karkat, results in not being taken seriously at all). The barbs mixed in with the flattery are effective because they lead the target to think, \"If this person really wants something from me, why would they insult me?\" Of course, this is how pick-up artists operate, which isn't far off from Vriska's mindset when pursuing her goals—which, although more broad than romantic goals, are still mixed in with them, with the end result being part of the overall power play. Over the course of her tactics focused on John to make herself more relevant, when actual romantic designs start seeping into the fabric of her manipulation campaign, that's when it all starts to get...A Little Bit Weird."

The romantic angle that surfaces from this effort, as I just implied, is vaguely troubling. How else to describe it... ? Icky, maybe? Something is off about it, and we feel that more than John does, obviously because we know a lot more about her than he does. For Vriska, are the romantic desires real? Is she such a mess inside that she wouldn't be able to tell whether the feelings are genuine or not? It's more likely that it's all about the ego boost, the power trip involved with grooming this hapless fool into the thing she wants him to be, and hoodwinking him into feeling something for her. But for him, it's probably more sincere. His first awkward experience with romance, albeit one contrived by a manipulator. Too bad he has no idea that none of this even has anything to do with him. It's still just about Vriska's gamesmanship with Terezi, who is another person exhibiting many of the aforementioned qualities of a manipulator. Terezi just uses hers to target a different boy.

They mainly protect the apparatus that is needed to begin the Sburb session and complete all the time loops leading to their arrival on the planet in the first place.

It turns out the guardians have no qualms about sacrificing the well-being of the planet if it helps them achieve their primary objective.

Karkat was the one mostly playing that role. But now that we've gone through all the material introducing Vriska and showing her trying to get to know John, it looks like she's the one stepping into that role instead, continuing to help pad out our understanding of the story and confirm various details and points of lore—to some extent, she's playing the role of an ambassador in an alien cultural exchange. Unlike when Karkat was ranting in Act 4, we actually know a lot about troll culture now. Watching the clash between the kids and trolls in their understandings of society and what it means to grow up is going to be a big part of the narrative from now on.

When she starts getting more real with him about her issues, it starts blurring the line on whether their romantic entanglement is just a means to an end for her or something grounded in mutual feelings between them. Very confused feelings, but maybe legit nonetheless, regardless of her original intentions. John is someone who appreciates sincere communication, no matter who it's with. Vriska is someone who never had a sympathetic listener, a person to talk to who wouldn't also regard her upbringing as \"culturally normal.\" There's a nexus of mutual sympathy here.

Karkat could have said it at any time in Act 4, but he didn't bother to because he was working backwards. He already gave his whole initial spiel to John at the end of John's timeline (I AM YOUR GOD!

Because readers watch the formula play out so often, they are trained heavily to respect the journey of the hero, to anticipate and crave its fulfillment, to see it as something verging on contractual in their relationship with a story. So a gut-response to this recklessness is like, \"ROSE, NO! STOP THAT! You simply must complete your quest and play the rain!\" What comes with this view is the feeling that her evolution as a character is only being delayed for a bit while she gets some anti-narrative foolishness out of her system, and then we'll get down to business and watch her do her quest, play a whole BUNCH of rain, and reap the narrative satisfaction. There's just one problem: she never does that. This candy-coated Kiddie Kwest is at no point ever taken seriously by Rose or the narrative itself, nor should it be. -->"

I'll keep hitting it though, because it's so deeply connected to Homestuck's nature as a narrative and why there are so many screwball progressions that don't sync up with familiar patterns in fiction. When trying to parse character arcs, we look out for certain beacons. So when we hear \"play the rain,\" we're like, ah, GOT IT. That's Rose's arc. Once she finally gets over this destructive teen bullshit, she can wise up, play the rain, and her arc will be finished. Wrong. This is almost a red herring arc. Her quest on this planet, its patronizing presentation, its intrinsic shallowness, is a mirage surrounding her that represents a fully regimented series of milestones for achievement and personal growth, much as society dubiously presents to young people in many forms. The true arc-within-the-arc is actually an upside-down version of what it appears to be. What Rose is doing now, which seems to be misguided recklessness taking her further away from the truth of herself, is actually better seen as a good start to her real journey: breaching the mirage of regimented growth, exposing it for the charade it is, and pulling the truth out of it. The real conflict in her arc comes not from the fact that she refuses to take it seriously, by destroying it and taking shortcuts. It's the opposite. It's that, upon trashing her planet, she continues to have this nagging sense that she should be taking this quest seriously, much like how a young adult may have a nagging sense of guilt that they aren't \"being an adult right\" by the time they approach adulthood. And this nagging, unanswerable guilt arises from the truth that the regimentation of adulthood is completely fake. It was always a mirage. Learning this, making peace with it, is part of the growing process for many, and it is for her too."

There are failed (a.k.a. tragic) arcs, where a character struggles to overcome flaws inside them but doesn't succeed, suffering miserably or dying as a result. Successful arcs are ones where the character does make the transformative journey and surmounts those internal obstacles. The things to identify are: what is the internal obstacle, how is it holding the character back, and what's the real process (not the presumed one) by which this actually takes place over a full story. So when we hear \"play the rain,\" if we take it at face value as a story arc element the supposition is: Rose struggles internally with an impulse to destroy, to cheat, to take shortcuts, and must overcome these immature impulses, take her rain quest seriously, enjoy the magical yields of doing so, and release her inner greatness. Okay, that's the presumed arc, and importantly, Rose herself presumes it's her arc too. But let's flip the whole thing around: Rose falsely diagnoses her own arc, \"rebels\" against it with acts of teen vandalism, obsesses over the knowledge it yields, becomes \"corrupted\" by said knowledge, struggles with depression, and later, alcoholism, and feels like something is wrong. Like resisting the quest was a mistake, a rejection of her designated path for growth. The guilt of resisting the false quest is the struggle. Letting go of that guilt and all cerebral intensity surrounding it is the overcoming process Rose needs to go through. Her arc is literally her deliverance from what she falsely perceives as her own arc. Confused yet??? Well, she sure was.

Which we could already surmise from Hivebent, but hey, now we're more formally telling the story of Kanaya and Rose, so we might as well start at the beginning again. Their interaction was never was genuinely antagonistic, it only went in that direction due to some misfires which we saw in Act 4. It was always grounded in admiration. This feature of their relationship, Kanaya's natural gravitation toward Rose, links easily to the topic of Rose's arc on previous pages. The intensity of Rose's focus on ripping the game apart, finding answers, and telling her quest to fuck off, and the level of empowerment and control over her fate that seems to embody, signals a certain degree of self-confidence. And confidence is something we've seen Kanaya struggle with. Rose's newfound flair for destruction and recklessness is also captivating to her. Remember that Kanaya's a sucker for \"meddling\" with dangerous girls. Their confidence pulls her in, the intellectual intensity and danger keep her hooked, and then her mothering need to \"protect\" starts kicking in.

Kanaya says Rose is \"white as a ghost.\" Well, Kanaya doesn't, the narrative does, which puts the statement at least one layer removed from actual observation. So, is this observation literally true about Rose? To our eye, her skin definitely appears to be paper-white. But then, so is her hair (observed to be blonde once). So are her clothes, desk, computer, floor, etc. This opens up the question of what here is meant to be understood as literally white versus what is shown as representationally white, i.e. a non-literal expression of \"blankness\" that the imagination can fill in as it pleases. This is a pretty interesting avenue of thought, involving certain philosophical inquiries into the subject of blankness, how blankness can be visually represented, what blankness means, and whether a truly blank abstraction can even really exist. -->"

Or is the presentation meant to be taken literally, with concrete depictions telling us what is truly intended to be taken as unalterable fact, and therefore not open to interpretation? A good example of the latter is eye color. Later, we see through deliberate close-up shots that the eye colors of the humans correspond to their text colors. The specificity and delivery of that information basically kills any interpretive latitude. That is what their eye colors literally are, whereas previously their eyes were just represented by black dots, which was the symbolic presentational default that came with their paper-doll avatars. This tells us that a simple presentation can begin with nonliteral attributes (like color), and then become assigned literal specificity later under certain conditions. It happens with the characters' eyes, but the same thing never happens with their skin tones. Which means they're all either literally white as ghosts, as the dubious narration suggests, or they're deliberately never assigned specificity, leaving precise tonal designation ambiguous. The only visual exception to this is a flagrantly satirical wind-up of this very issue that takes place in what is indisputably the hottest fucking mess in Homestuck by far, the Trickster arc. -->"

If someone has hard ideas about character depictions always needing to be specific and fixed—that there's no such thing as interpretational freedom or reader agency in creating the meaning of a text—then it won't matter if you draw a cartoon face on a paper plate and shout, BEHOLD: ABSTRACTION!

She can't risk going full fangirl before the friendship deal is sealed, because that could fuck up the befriending process. Once she determines it's safe, she can start revealing traces of the hero worship a little more, but while still showing some restraint, as Kanaya's doing here. Like, \"Oh, yeah. It was pretty good.

That's what makes this a great example of how Homestuck works.

Things such as the end of the world, death and resurrection, alternate selves, and time travel. Like, \"u time travelin dude?\", \"yeah guess so\", \"oh that's cool i guess. hey let's spend the next 50 lines arguing about money\", \"yeah totally\". But even this principle is being a little bit spoofed by John (again, very casually) reminding Dave that he sounds jaded about his own kickass time adventures. So part of this overly casual pattern is for straight-up comedic effect, I guess. That probably goes without saying. I think it also functions as a corollary to HS treating \"awesome background lore and puzzles\" with a sense of frivolity, dismissing them as things unworthy of much overt scrutiny or interest by the characters. It's the backgrounding of the extraordinary, and the foregrounding of the mundane, in order to focus on relationships, character profiles, and arcs. If the kids were always flying off the deep end about how INSANE it is that the world ended, or how CRAZY it is that Dave can time travel now, that would absorb way too much of the conversational focus and we would not be experiencing the story and characters as intended.\n\nThe \"years of bitter ass famine\" line sounds like a euphemism for one of the comic's longer pauses over its tenure. Like the gigapause. Everybody was just starving for ass by the time that was about to end. I had stored up an awful lot of ass to hand out by then too. But enough about GAME OVER. That's probably going to be printed about ten books from now, when I am a senior citizen. Anyway, on a more substantive note, a key takeaway from this conversation is that, after arguing uselessly about money for a couple pages, John and Dave are twigging onto the influence their respective Scourge Sister allies are starting to have on them, in speaking habits and otherwise. Neither boy is that approving of what they observe from the other, sowing the seeds of a bro-schism. This probably does more than anything to help convey the fact that Vriska and Terezi primarily view these two boys as conduits for their own rivalry and use them as such. They basically looked at both John and Dave and took that \"choose your fighter\" meme very literally."

I don't remember exactly when it started... But I began hoarding these graphics because they reminded me of Dave, or more specifically, the type of image one of Dave's friends would show him, perhaps strategically altered like this, in order to give him a hard time. Terezi is the perfect foil for this idea, of course. And since Dave is a true coolkid, he can't let it be known that he feels owned by it, and just rolls with it instead. In fact, due to their high compatibility with his own sense of humor, there's no way he isn't being genuine when he says these things are incredible. He really means it. And he's right, this shit absolutely is incredible. Top-shelf content by literally any standard.\n\nCompared to the John/Vriska conversations, this exchange gives the sense that Dave and Terezi get along a little more organically than the other two. There's a similar teasing, neggy dynamic here, but they seem to at least be starting on a similar wavelength, with both being interested in bad comics, scamming rubes out of loot, and talking about how cool Dave is. Terezi has a similar purpose as Vriska, to use this guy as an extension of their rivalry, but it also feels like she'd be just as fine dropping the rivalry aspect and instead just making a cool new friend. Vriska's solicitation feels like a higher-stake game, more heavy-handed. She's a bit more forced in the way that she tries to mold John in her image, and more overt or desparate-seeming in her flirtatious methods. She gets flustered, whereas Terezi does not. Certain things seem to come easier for Terezi, which is part of what fuels the old rivalry. Vriska seems to have some jealousy issues about it, which were expressed in Hivebent through Terezi's more cunning manipulation methods, which don't need any special powers. Since Vriska's insecurity tells her this stuff doesn't come as easy to her as it does for Terezi, she feels like she has to cheat through use of mind control and such. The insecurity over \"things come easy for her, but not for me\" seems to be a lot of what's behind Vriska's brute-force approach to certain things, which includes completely dominating John's attention for most of the remaining act.\n\nDave pretends he doesn't understand how this masterpiece he just made could be interpreted as pornographic, even though the final panel literally has Terezi acknowledging that she is sexually aroused by the act of splashing into the top of the Kool-Aid Man's head. Maybe Dave knows exactly what he's doing. Maybe he's being \"too cool\" to admit it. Maybe everybody here low-key knows the score when it comes to all kinds of subtext. Maybe low-key knowing the score in virtually all situations is the very definition of \"being cool.\" And hence, you have just understood what my secret is to being so cool.

It's a clear challenge for him to throw off these shackles, or escape out from under this large, looming shadow.

Basically, his childhood training-trauma results in aversion to violence that fuels his \"resistance to the call\" feelings. Resistance to the call is a common step in the hero's journey. What's probably less common is the resistance being due to abusive conditioning from the training for that (supposed) journey. Usually in such arcs, the hero resists but then stops resisting in some triumphant moment, overcoming the inner obstacle that caused the resistance. But with Dave, it doesn't quite pan out that way. There isn't this moment where he says \"SCREW my abusive past, I need to MAN UP and KILL LORD ENGLISH!\" The resolution progresses through a more psychological manner than that. It's similar to the structure of Rose's arc in that way. Both characters know there's this thing they should be doing, as informed by their understanding of how heroic narratives work, so they feel some guilt and struggle with their reluctance or inability to rise to the challenges of the regimented journey of personal growth. The resolution isn't about finding the inner grit to complete their plainly evident arcs by rote (which would therefore validate certain things about them, such as, if Dave fully embraced his destiny as a warrior, maybe that just vindicates Bro's methods?). It's more about finding release from the psychological burden of these narrative-mandated pressures and becoming more complete not as a warrior or a hero, but as a person. Someone who can make peace with their flaws, forgive themselves and others, and move forward in life with a greater understanding of themselves and a better adjusted sense of priorities."

Dave handles it the way I assume many guys would, which is through a vaguely detached series of counter-trolling measures.\n\nHere comes the good shit. Thank god I put this comic in here. What would Homestuck be without award-winning decisions such as this? I mean, aside from respectable. Cool Dude and Stoner Lou was the precursor comic to Sweet Bro and Hella Jeff. And both comics were made specifically to spoof other people's bad comics involving this sort of content. Much like with SBaHJ, I bestowed that creation upon Dave and designated him as the fictional creator of the content that in truth I was responsible for before Homestuck began. Same thing here with CDaSL. Note how Dave's presenting this work in a flashback, casting it as a precursor work to SBaHJ, which he still considers to be a \"vision\" he is tinkering with, which is roughly true of the IRL progression of this content. (Though I wasn't taking this shit nearly as seriously as Dave is here, on an artistic basis. For me this was ludicrous shitpost stuff taking place on old forums.)\n\nIt seems Terezi provides the kernel of inspiration for Dave's next artistic endeavor, SBaHJ. Which also somewhat tracks reality, since originally SBaHJ stemmed from a playful roast of some guy's bad gamer comic, and in particular isolated certain peculiarities about the style, like the strange way the mouths were drawn. That's just how it happens. We all inspire and influence each other, even with our bad stuff. Sometimes our bad stuff gives people more to think about and find unlikely inspiration from than our good stuff. My bet is the guy who was the original subject of my roast is a thousand times more pleased to see his crappy comic left a lasting legacy in the way it did, than he felt any real lasting sense of pride or attachment to his bad comic. There is no way I wouldn't feel the same way if I were in his position.\n\nCry like a girl? Terezi, we need to have a talk about this internalized misogyny, which your planet supposedly doesn't even have. This was an important line though, because it established that Terezi had the objective of making Dave cry, which she finally succeeds in doing when we hop back to the \"present.\" Some might say that bamboozling him into a vat of soup surrounded by crocodiles chopping onions actually constitutes a desperate measure.

Terezi actually seems to want a real friend, or maybe more than a friend, whereas Vriska's chief objectives are victory, conquest, relevance—all the sort of things that don't lend themselves to being the foundation of a quality relationship. Daverezi, being an authentic relationship, has real legs and makes some pretty deep headway into Act 6 before it slams into a brick wall of pure clown lust. But that's a very different issue."

This is the smoking gun confirmation that not only does Vriska now have a thing for Cage, but also is likely potently attracted to Equius, at least physically. She may get a kick out of pushing around impressionable nerds like Tavros and John, but what really gets her fired up is a filthy, sweaty slab of beef with a mullet and a wife beater. In a way, it's almost surprising that during the dress-up session with John, she didn't take the opportunity to make him look like Nic Cage. Instead she gave him the Vriska Look. Which just goes to show, if there's one person she loves more than anyone, it's herself.\n\nWe're already calling back to the opening animation of A5A2, when Karkat hateswoons over John.

Which meant I didn't have to bother doing any mind-bending calculations. That freed me up to focus on what's really important here, which is boys yelling at each other about romance problems.\n\nThere's so much happening here, it gets overwhelming to try to document it. Which was also true of the memos in Hivebent. Let's go for a swim through this slurry of red, blue, and gray and see what morsels we find. Dave telling John they have to be on record as not caring, then dunking on him for not knowing that quadrants come in fours... First of all, that's obviously funny. Let's all have a laugh for a second. Okay, that's done. It also reveals a feature of Dave's conversational strategy that doesn't become exposed until he's forced to participate in an exchange that's not one-on-one. He projects an appearance of not caring as a matter of policy to establish tone and control the conversational agenda. Don't give the opponent any ammunition to use against you. This breaks down when a conversational ally is present, but isn't on the same page. John is way too eager to learn about troll romance, which is ruining Dave's flow, making his weapons against Karkat less effective. Then it all quickly spirals out of control to become a reasonably earnest jam between bros about girls they may or may not like, while Karkat looks on in horror. Then what happens?\n\nWhat happens is that Dave starts sussing out John's interest in Vriska in a fairly innocent way, as if he's ready to tell John to go for it, if he's feeling it. But remember that earlier, Dave was warning John to stay away from Vriska. Bear in mind, though, that was a future Dave, and we've been backtracking to his earlier exploits with Terezi. Eventually, Dave comes around to Karkat's view that Vriska is not to be toyed with, even though it's unlikely Karkat will get any credit for this advance warning. So what happens between now and then to change Dave's tune? Anti-Vriska propaganda from Terezi...or something else? It's worth keeping an eye out for. There's still way too much to talk about here, so I won't even bother. Except to point out that Karkat and Dave say more gay stuff, Karkat keeps talking about Dave's lips, and Dave accuses Karkat of being gay, and he's right, Karkat is gay, but also Dave is gay too, and they're both gay, and they both definitely end up kissing each other years from now. Sorry, that's the only other thing I wanted to point out about this.\n\nI probably don't even have to bother stating for the record that Karkat's shipping diagram is the stuff of legends. It bluntly illustrates the truth that any reader must have confronted by now, which is that the human hetero shipping matchups can only result in one configuration by default. Of course, it doesn't play out quite this way (except Dave x Jade, but that's sort of a sideshow involving Davesprite). The incest pairings are stated as non-viable, although at least for Dave and Rose, the topic just seems to keep getting dragged back into the spotlight more than you might expect, or want. It disregards troll-human matchups (Karkat actively campaigning against them here is probably the best evidence we have at this point that they are definitely going to happen), and also ignores Beta-Alpha Kid matchups, because nobody knows yet that they're all going to meet kid versions of their parents, let alone consider dating them. Karkat makes a valiant effort here, and if nothing else reveals himself to be one of the most entertaining Bad Artists in the story. That is, until Caliborn comes along, who has a similar aesthetic, is much worse (but gets better), and uses his skills for similar purposes. The fact that Karkat and Caliborn have a bit of overlap in personality and typing style may correlate somewhat with their artistic sensibilities as well. Like there's a certain part of the brain that's overactive in both kids, and possibly in all very special boys of their ilk.\n\nIt's possible that one of the more entertaining results of Karkat's grid is that John appears to take the advice seriously on some level. Dave blows it off (yet actually does end up dating Jade in some capacity), whereas John, who plainly has no iromantic traction with Rose at any point in the story, seems to take it to heart, as if this really is his duty if they want to advance the human race. Nothing ever really comes of that, but there are moments where you can tell it's still on his mind, like in the [S] Seer: Descend game, where you play as John and Grimdark Rose. Speaking of playable games, it's time for the first instance of these RPG-style behemoths. They're monstrously big in print, at least. This one picks up on a key point in the timeline that the story has already led us to wonder about: when does Karkat wake up, why was he asleep for so long, and what did he see in his dreams? The player gets to walk around, talk to all the trolls in the lab, and find out the answers at their own pace. It ends up being a lot. But that's what makes the format engaging, in its native medium, conveying a feeling that there is much to freely explore. Does it work in a book? Well, let's find out."

      "004692": [
        {
          "content": ">1 As the command implies, you wake up as Karkat after a long, grim nap. He was asleep when Prospit was destroyed, killing his dream self and trapping him in his sleep for a while, for mysterious reasons. Regardless of the narrative purpose it serves or the questions it answers, this game was an EXCITING HOMESTUCK MOMENT when it was released, dropping in out of nowhere. It was another one of those instances where readers had no idea a certain format was in Homestuck's arsenal, then it dropped without any warning at all, and with barely any pause preceding it (maybe a few days in this case). And just like that, a new type of content became \"something Homestuck is capable of doing, and may continue doing in the future.\" And that did turn out to be true. There are at least another three games like this. One later in this book where John explores a village, the aforementioned one with Rose and John, and another one involving Equius, Nepeta, and Gamzee during the throes of Murderstuck. Each has different tonalities and story purposes. The Rose/John one has a melancholy atmosphere, a sense of dramatic irony over slain parents on a roof. The latter one is essentially purely in the horror genre. But in this one here, the atmosphere is mainly, HEY LOOK! THIS IS A THING WE CAN DO NOW! IT'S PRETTY COOL! By my recollection, there were few who disagreed.\n\nThere's a predictable consequence to having this one game take up so many pages: it means suddenly I have to make A LOT OF EXTRA NOTES. And I'm sorry, folks, but I just don't think I can in good conscience come up with unique notes for when Karkat finds a fucking bottle of Faygo or a couple boondollars in a chest next to a transporter after walking down five flights of stairs or something. This is as good an excuse as any to begin reinstituting the GENIUS policy I introduced in the previous book, which can be summarized as, \"not doing notes for certain pages, if I don't feel like it.\" I can just skip those pages! It's totally fine. Sure, you'll miss me on those pages, but you know what they say about absence making the heart grow fonder. And when I finally come back to say something stupid, you may feel slightly less inclined to throw the book across the room.\n\n>(no page: not included in screenshots) Returning to say: You can go up to that computer and \"Finish responding to Kanaya in memo.\" So even though we see their talksprites, this isn't actually an in-person conversation. It's Current Karkat and Past Kanaya. This initiates part of a memo conversation we read in the previous book (Book 4, page 404, if you care to go back and review the context, or page 2567 on Homestuck.com). Back then, we already caught a glimpse of this moment just after Karkat woke up, through a very narrow sliver of what takes place in this game. It reminds us that his entire critical nap was precipitated by the fact that he passed out when Kanaya cut off Tavros's legs. When he woke up, he finally decided to close the book on this memo to clean up the loose ends, which he's doing here. Very tidy of him, and me.\n\n>2 We're back. That [8-9, 52-54] was the completion of a minor \"arc\" on this minigame's terms. You get to the Cage room, and that's that for Vriska. It unlocks another part of the game you can play, which starts here.\n\n>3 Another quick hop-to-the-future vignette establishing another key point on the timeline to keep track of, which is \"Aradiabot Explodes. \" Similar to how we had a \"Jadebot Explodes\" key moment to track earlier that's revealed in [S] Descend, which covers the \"when\" and \"why\" about it. So we're possibly set up to expect a similar type of revelation concerning this moment. Its revelation is nearly on the same energy wavelength of narrative sensationalism as Descend, broadcast through an animation covering the destruction of Prospit and Derse. This is around when A5A2 starts going full blast. There's a significant period in this sub-act when the crazy intense stuff just never seems to let up. But these stockpiled little mysteries have to be seeded like this for those revelations to have the right impact.\n\n>4 The horn pile is established through this game as a critical fixture in the troll lab, referenced repeatedly and almost always in the context of being used as a bed. There is no reason for its existence aside from the fact that Gamzee is a sloppy, useless, clowny piece of complete garbage. He dances by the pile perpetually throughout this game, also for no reason. One thing this game can do, which Homestuck in general can also do, is spontaneously hop to another point in the timeline to check something out. In this case, \"Be Future Feferi\" hops three hours ahead to when she's sleeping on the horn pile, trapped in her Dark Nap. And we quickly return from that future vignette to resume play. This is one way we flesh out the full series of timeline events.\n\n>5 Being able to switch characters is an important part of the \"feel\" you get from these games. Loses a little something here. (But what doesn't?) When you assume control of a new character, the song changes, and it alters the perspective a little. Now you go around talking to people as Vriska instead of Karkat, and you have to switch your psychology a bit. Vriska is going to offer a very different side to these conversations now, and the responses and attitudes she elicits from others is going to be different too. These are pretty obvious points I'm making, but they're still worth noting, because splashing this type of content into the rest of the story really illustrates how it differs as a storytelling tool, what kind of things you can do with it, and the many interesting ways it shapes reader perception as compared to the more static content.\n\n>7 Another future time hop, another explosion to track. Put another pin on the insane timeline you've got scattered all over your wall like a lunatic, and continue. All of this will be explained. This incident involves Rose, in response to conduct from Eridan that will in no way come as surprising. [continued on page 45]\n\n>8 We've already spent a little time on a similar meteor in the Veil in the human session. So we know stuff like this is lying around, big glass tubes full of test subjects, usually big mutant chess freaks that get deployed on the Battlefield. Here's one that's busted. We're getting foreshadowed at here, in a way that games commonly do. Uh-oh! There should be a monster safely contained here, and yet it seems to have escaped! Suuuure hope you don't have to confront this beast in some way later!\n\n>9 Here's a boss battle. It's not real, of course. There's no combat or anything. You just choose some options and it sort of plays itself. Who has time to \"make real games\" when the games in question take several days to make? This was a pretty fun diversion, though. We even switched the sprite style briefly, from what is usually an Earthbound-inspired look to what I believe was mimicking the sprite style in a Scott Pilgrim game. If this were a real battle, it would probably be pretty strenuous. I'm guessing the boss's udder would be some sort of weak point? But Vriska just cheats her way through it, which is fine, because we don't have all day.\n\n>10 Immediate dividends of this format included the introduction of the \"talksprite.\" People loved these things, made their own, and looked forward to any additional representations of the characters that looked like this. They added some flavor to the dialogue, showing facial expressions to go along with certain lines, which I think definitely changed the feel of the dialogue compared to the previously unillustrated pesterlogs. Since this was a new idea, and also since these games got made with such INSANE speed by a variety of artists without the luxury of style sheets or anything, they come across as a little wonky in this first game. All over the place in terms of style. But that's Homestuck for you. The sprites served their purpose and were all pretty good on their own terms.\n\nTime to catch up with Terezi now. Due to the expanded nature of this format, on this page we make it...a full SIX lines deep into this conversation before we have to turn the page. perhaps it's time to address the elephant in the room. This game (again, a single page on the website), occupies about ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY PAGES in this book. Was there a better way to do this, to save space? Probably. Maybe we could have made like, maps? Compressed the conversations into a linear, non-illustrated text format by omitting some of the talksprites? Maybe we could have cut the page count in half or such. Would that have been worth it? We would lose a few things, the flavor to the conversations that the talksprites add and such. Also, the more you mess around with trickery like that, the more the layout decisions start piling up. And pretty soon you realize, it's just easier to start charging through this material with pure screencaps alone, and maybe at the end of the day, that's fine, and it's a decent way to read all this in a book, and nobody's actually complaining, except me. And even I'm not really. I'm just typing longass posts down here as usual, which for some unfathomable reason I have taken to calling \"posts.\"\n\nI'm about to start skipping notes like a madman. But first, here's Karkat bringing up the \"demon\" again. It's supposed to be this huge mystery, but come on. Let's be grown-ups here. It's just Bec Noir. We all know it. But the story toys with this mystery through its nonlinear presentation. Karkat seems to suspect it's Jack (without the text being totally clear about that), but he's not sure, since Bec Noir looks so different. He needs to do more research to confirm it for himself, but he will. Which means that later on, he knows the demon is Jack, but the story dexterously weaves around having him spill this info to the reader, using methods like we're seeing above. When the time is exactly right ([S] Jade: Enter) the information is revealed to us in grand fashion, a device otherwise known as a \"major plot development.\" I find that's a pretty good way to reveal things, because having people just say the things can be a little boring. And it would be a shame to waste even a single precious drop of your boredom until I have you exactly where I want you, which is trapped with me, right down here in the Laugh Gutter. Anyway, on that note, bye for a while.\n\n>12 A lot of these conversations mainly involve Karkat insisting he thinks these aliens are boring and he'll want nothing to do with them. The lens of dramatic irony of course frames these proclamations as ridiculous, and even Sollux finds it laughable, because he is privy to the same sense of dramatic irony we are through reading the future memos. He brings this up, and Karkat naturally pounces on the opportunity to lambaste Future Karkat. And oh yeah, also Past Karkat, he's even worse, and maybe while he's at it, Current Karkat too, because wow, fuck that guy. Since we learn that Karkat is initially reluctant to troll the humans, it retroactively sets up a punchline to this joke that asks \"what made him change his mind?\" And we already know the punchline. It's because he falls in hate with John.\n\n>13 We don't get a lot of banter from Aradiabot before this. Aside from her vicious beatdown of Vriska, which characterizes her pretty well through action alone, we don't have much of a sense for what she's like verbally, in contrast with her ghost self and formerly alive self. She's incredibly moody, angry, and fatalistic. She lets timeline \"spoilers\" slip casually but doesn't care due to both her intense nihilism and the fact that nothing can really be changed. She is one of the striking early examples of revealing the full depth of a character's comprehensive personality by showing different facets of them through different \"versions\" of the character.\n\nAradia is kind of a linear example of that concept, though. She goes from alive --> ghost --> frog --> robot to alive again, all in sequence in the same timeline. Which means these facets come across as character evolution, not hypothetical alternate presentations. Distributed characterization approaches happen a lot more later in the story, through methods using splintered alternate selves, such as Dave-Davesprite—Davepeta, Jade—Jadesprite, Dirk-AR Dirk—Arquiusprite, or Vriska-(Vriska). Aradia serves as a pretty good trial run for some of these ideas, partly by illustrating how different one person can be under different circumstances.\n\n>14 You can talk to anyone you want when you gain control of Karkat, but here in the book it sorta makes sense to check with Feferi first, since it gets right to the point of what happens when you go to sleep without a dream self. Karkat ominously advises against this. Feferi is a good foil for this topic, because it reminds us that in an earlier memo we saw, three hours after Karkat wakes up, Derse is destroyed too, which traps Feferi in her sleep like Karkat just was. In fact, she knows this already, because she got the memo too and wants to trap herself in the nap deliberately. We'll keep tabs on that. Another key element of this game is Karkat waking up to everyone buzzing about these new alien kids they found. So this gives us insight into Karkat's first exposure to the humans, and the origin of his decision to organize a trolling effort against them. It's kind of an interesting wrinkle to the troll timeline. It shows the rest of the trolls were pretty deep into interacting with the kids before Karkat even knew about them, which is not the impression we got when we first heard from Karkat. He's actually pretty late to the party, which shouldn't surprise us by now.\n\n>15 Nepeta is understandably one of the trolls most excited about the human discovery. Possibly more excited than anyone. And she's forbidden from talking to them, which causes Karkat, out of spite for Equius, to order her to talk to them a lot. So given that Nepeta is excited about the humans and has been COMMANDED by her crush to interact with them, it's a little surprising that we barely ever see her talk to the humans on-screen. Or is it? It probably just means she has dozens of offscreen conversations with all of them, all throughout the timeline, but they aren't important enough to show because they're just a bunch of useless roleplaying, and also Nepeta is a borderline useless character with nothing that important to say about anything. Sorry, Nep, but your metatextually exaggerated uselessness as a minor character has been well-established as a critical feature of your profile in many of these author notes by now. Haven't you been paying attention?\n\n>16 Karkat makes a pretty good point. If Tavros was going to get robo-legs at all, why not during the session, which would have allowed him greater mobility in a physically demanding environment? And Tavros makes a pretty disturbing point. He didn't actually consent to having his legs sawed off and replaced. These people are disasters. It does make you wonder about Kanaya's motivation. Mothering gone overboard? Erasing the most major lasting effect of Vriska's bullying, which she continues to use as ammunition against Tavors for years after, including during the session? Perhaps the answer to this second question also answers the first posed by Karkat. Kanaya and Equius never got around to the leg transplant during the session because they could never find a moment alone with Tavros without Vriska looming over him. They got to this meteor, found their chance, and took it.\n\nThe rest of the conversation is dedicated to making sure we all know that Tavros doesn't have the slightest idea what's actually going on right now. Sounds about right.\n\n>17 Karkat orders Equius never to give anyone horse legs. Which I believe is an order he manages to follow. His ancestor Horuss, however, is a different story. I doubt Kankri ever specifically ordered Horuss not to give Rufioh horse legs. Or maybe he did, but Horuss didn't listen, because people somehow take Kankri even less seriously than Karkat.\n\nI'm just going to use this conversation as an excuse point out that one reason why this game format is really good is that it gives practically everyone an excuse to talk to everyone else without making a huge deal out of it and wildly inflating the online page count. God, I'm so clever. All I really managed to do was wildly inflate the book page count, many years later.\n\n>18 By now we know that Karkat's \"trolling campaign,\" which seemed like it was the Whole Point of the trolls back in Act 4, is completely trivial and comically meaningless. And we have a great appreciation for why that is now, because we know two facts. 1) There are several trolls on this roster who are much more ruthless and cunning than Karkat is, mainly revolving around the Scourge Sister dynamic we didn't know about before. And 2) Karkat spent a long time asleep on the floor before he even heard of the humans, enabling the troublemakers to run wild hatching plans and messing with humans before he had a chance to do anything. So the real \"shadow plan\" related to the troll engagement with humans was always overwhelmingly focused on Vriska and Terezi's intense meddling efforts. But we had no appreciation for this at all in Act 4, because our gateway to learning about the trolls was presented through Karkat's screaming. In a way, his blustering trolling effort was a great decoy for Vriska and Terezi to use as cover while they went about their scheming sort of under the radar.\n\n>19 Translation of that last panel: I think you should consider scoping out that Egbert kid's sweet ass before you write them all off as a waste of time.\n\nHere's another key point, which I'm not sure if I referenced yet: Karkat's Big Speech. It's a moment on the timeline that we've seen numerous allusions to already. We have no idea how good the speech is, because we don't get to read it. Some trolls seem to think it's good, like Kanaya. But one thing is indisputable. It is directly inspired by how hot Karkat thinks John is.\n\n>20 Gamzee allows you to sleep on the horn pile for 420 boondollars. In this sense, he's like an RPG innkeeper. Except the service he is offering is worse than useless. Just like him.\n\n>22 Terezi is frustrated beyond words that her bonehead ex-almost-boyfriend doesn't see what the big deal is about a moon made of gold. Just another indication that what she really values is a partner who has a deep appreciation for the value of riches. Dave easily beats Karkat in that regard. But it also sheds a little more light on the fact that no one will ever truly be able to compete with Vriska when it comes to Terezi's fixation.\n\n>25 Feferi is right, the humans are the answer. But not because they actually have a good plan for solving all the problems. That never happens, in fact. The real reason is because they're the main characters. Leave it to one of the least important characters to have sort of a sixth sense when it comes to identifying the most important characters, even when no one else can.\n\n>26 Nepeta almost immediately confirms to Terezi that she's been roleplaying with Dave somewhere on the timeline, by referencing his fursona, Akwete Purrmusk. This seems like a dumb, throwaway gag that will be meaningless forever, and it very nearly was. Until, at the last minute, the story dumps Davepeta in our laps. Nepeta literally fuses with another version of Dave to help him fully realize his fursona. A truly heartwarming end point for both their arcs.\n\nNepeta, maybe Jade just isn't into it? Maybe learn to take a fucking hint?? Sure, it seems like you two SHOULD get along, but what if that's just not how things always work? Don't be a rando. Just chill out. Mr. Purrmusk has shown a perfectly reliable willingness to tolerate your nonsense. Strider's roleplay fields have proven to be rich and fertile. Now stop wasting Jade's time, and go embrace your destiny.\n\n>27 A fair question: Who's a worse influence on Tavros, Vriska or Terezi? Sure, Vriska paralyzes him in the first place, and pretty soon she will murder him in cold blood. But at least she keeps it real. For some reason Terezi insists on enabling his bullshit with a lot of misguided positivity and support. Just sickening, really. In due time, Terezi will pay a very steep karmic price for this crime, by having her Vriska privileges revoked.\n\nThen Tavros fucks off to go fall down a whole bunch of stairs. We'll catch up with his point of view later. Mainly by watching him fall down some stairs.\n\n(no page: not shown in screenshots) I said that we'd catch up with Tavros and his struggle with stairs later, but I forgot that actually happens within the same game. So what this means is, there are even more moments of Tavros falling down the stairs to look forward to after this game is finished. Pretty exciting stuff.\n\n>28 A little glimpse into the background of how their boyfight proxy-rivalry kicked off. It seems like Terezi gets dragged into it reluctantly at first, and considers a lot of Vriska's goading to be childish, crazy, and obsessive. But at the end of the day, Terezi seems to get just as into the boy rivalry as Vriska does. This is probably how a lot of their competitions went in the past. It also speaks to the addictive quality that this unhealthy aspect of their relationship has, particularly for Terezi. She knows it's not good for her but can't seem to help getting roped back into the bullshit. After Vriska's death, Terezi's guilt-slash-withdrawal symptoms lead her to fill the addiction void with a trash clown. Which is a bit like being on some potent controlled substance, getting cut off, and getting hooked on the hard stuff to compensate. Shooting up in back alleys, turning tricks in exchange for more... Actually, in Gamrezi's case, those two ideas end up being more or less the same thing.\n\n>30 Finally we can ferret out some new plot-relevant information from an obscure pocket of this game. We last saw Rose talking about the Green Sun upon revealing its existence, but we've heard nothing about a plan for using it in some way to defeat Jack Noir. This is some advance notice to watch out for a plan like that to start coming together. It's just a little tidbit to get us thinking. There's still lots of information missing, including: Jack is also the demon the trolls are hiding from, he's been Bec-ified, thus he draws his energy from the Green Sun, ergo it stands to reason that destroying the sun will weaken him. We have quite a ways to go to get up to speed on all that, unless you don't mind skipping down here to my notes where I casually and carelessly spoil you on literally everything, because I don't really see a good reason not to.\n\n>31 Take note of the phrase \"unexpected honk jump\" as a sign of oblique, yet retroactively blatant foreshadowing for the Gamrezi ship.\n\n>32 You have to be pretty alert to tell when someone is hitting on you in the clubs quadrant. It's subtle enough to miss easily. \"Hey, could you tell that bastard over there he's a bastard for me? And don't you DARE think of watering down my message of hate for me, so as to moderate this unpleasant rivalry I'm placing you in the middle of!\" Okay, that's an obvious clubs solicitation. But usually they don't sound like that. You know how sometimes in bar fights, there's the guy who wants to start a fight, but he tries to get his friends to \"hold him back\"? That's textbook solicitation in the ashen quadrant. Apparently rowdy, drunken bros do it all the time.\n\n>35 Sollux x Feferi is a romance that in my view is quite deftly handled offscreen. You see hints of it, like in how Feferi's fishspeak slips into Sollux's language. Some people notice, like Vriska, and get annoyed. Which is a thing that's been going on in a larger sense, actually, characters detecting traces of other character's speech patterns rubbing off on another, and using this as a clue that something romantic is brewing. Vriska with John, Terezi with Dave. Even Jade starts flagrantly swearing more than she typically does after more interaction with Karkat. Rose and Kanaya already basically talk like each other, so they can't really tip other people off to what's going on there. Although I guess you could infer that the moment Rose Starts Talking Like This, maybe it's a sign that they both finally went all the way. Not that this ever actually happens. Although to be fair, by the time they're both in a position for anything like that to hypothetically take place, Rose is drunk off her ass anyway.\n\n>36 Sure, Aradiabot could probably break her neck. But what we aren't supposed to know yet is that Vriska is god tier. So would it be a Just Death? I guess it depends on how sick the burn is that warrants having her neck snapped by Aradia. Maybe that's why Aradia doesn't bother? These burns are kind of weak, so she knows Vriska would just come back to life.\n\n>37 This conversation provides a very rare glimpse into the possibility that Feferi may have a more interesting personality than she gets credit for. Playing mind games to own Vriska, even if it's just in a meaningless throwaway conversation, isn't a bad thing to have on your resume. But again, it's my sad duty to remind you that, whatever other surprises may exist in the full range of her profile, Feferi just doesn't last much longer than this. She and Nepeta really can't catch a break. Luckily, they both experience profound narrative redemption much later, in the form of Fefeta. I believe Fefeta's stirring, ten-page soliloquy after she gets created really captures the pathos behind their mutual struggle with narrative irrelevance. Keep an eye out for that.\n\n>38 Nepeta, how fucking DARE you stifle Vriska's creativity. Her spidersona is probably GREAT. You see? Shit like this is why you get such a raw deal in this story. Maybe if you were cooler and played ball with her spidersona and Mindfang a little more, things could have turned out differently for you. It didn't have to be this way...it's just sad.\n\n>39 What an incredible line in that second panel [\"8eing a8le to walk suits you so much 8etter. Have I ever told you how much of a loser you were when you were a cripple? It's a real shame a8out how that had to happen to you.\"]. Sometimes I have to sit back and just marvel at the great things I made her say. Or was she the one who made me make her say the things? I wouldn't be surprised if that were true. I think the next self-insert segment raises this possibility implicitly, by putting her little icon over my forehead. What's the truth? Is she the one writing all this? I think we start to see, as her plan with human meddling starts to play out, that this is exactly what she's trying to do, at least in a retroactive sense. Overwriting the actions of others with her own intent, putting her \"brand\" on things, casting herself as \"responsible\" in hindsight for actions that she technically did not author. Though it seems like a cheap trick, it really does have the effect of blurring original intent, and we can lose our bearings on who exactly was responsible for what. So I'll ask again. Who's more real, Vriska or me? Not so sure now, are you???\n\n>40 One of Vriska's many great attributes is how she just genuinely does not give the slightest fuck about so many things. The \"cutting through the bullshit\" part of her personality is mainly what's behind her power as a narrative driver who can turbocharge the plot and move things along in compelling, albeit chaotic ways. But another advantage to this quality is it allows me to bring certain conversational trains of thought to a dead stop sometimes. We really don't need to read more of this shit right now, Equius. Sorry, man.\n\n>42 Looks like Kanaya's still a little frosty from their breakup. You know, because of the relationship they had, which never took place anywhere except for in Kanaya's mind. The breakup also took place in her mind. You can understand why she's a bit upset.\n\nVriska unsurprisingly is quite obtuse about why Kanaya has been standoffish since she gave her the fairy dress. I'm sure I commented on this at the time, but Vriska speculating that Kanaya had a thing for Tavros is just a shout-out to the bold individuals who speculated the same thing when she saw them kiss. It's about as humorously dense for a reader to make that speculation as it is for Vriska to do the same thing here.\n\n>43 The best explanation for why Gamzee says he's scared of Vriska, in my opinion, is this: he's flat-out lying. It's a good way for him to maintain his cover as \"Soft Gamzee.\" It also provides some ammunition for those who, against all sense of good taste and judgment, want to continue to believe and assert that Gamzee is a decent guy with sensitive emotions and vulnerabilities before he undergoes his Murderstuck awakening. He was none of those things, ever.\n\n>44 Vriska's brief conversations with Kanaya and Eridan in close vicinity help convey a likely truth about her. Most of the \"relationships\" she has tend to take place inside the minds of the people she messes with. The only one for whom this definitively proves not to be true in the long run is Terezi.\n\n>45 Actually...it's basically explained here. What I mean is, we will get to read this conversation in due time. Also, no, Vriska does not detect blackrom in the air. Rose isn't interested either. No one is, or ever will be. Wait, I take that back. Cronus is the only exception.\n\n>(Vriska's walkaround, not shown in screenshots) Okay, there's a lot to keep up with on this page. I know this comic gets pretty dense sometimes, but hang in there. If you really take the time to study it, you'll get it all eventually. Keep an eye out for the Author Notes Expansion Pack later, wherein I expound upon this page with the thoroughness it deserves. \n\nVriska keeps the Tavros's severed legs in a chest because...she just does. She's Vriska. She gets to do stuff like that, and we don't get to ask why. Any questions? You aren't allowed to have questions. Here's a tangential consideration that you may not want to think about it, but let's just consider this your punishment for daring to question Vriska's motives. If you take into account Tavros's lower torso, which has been hoarded here, and the existence of alchemy, I think we can begin to see the basic constituents for the origin of the bull penis cane. An item which, like many things on this meteor, eventually finds its way to the Felt Mansion in the future. Now, did you need to be forced to think about how Vriska may have quite literally used the mutilated remains of her ex-boyfriend to make a bovine dildo? No, you didn't. But as I said, you brought this upon yourself.\n\n>46 You can transportalize to another room full of transporters, each one labeled with a troll sign. Only the troll of that sign can use it, as if each one took the time to specifically claim one and lock everyone else out. When did they find the time to do this? It seems very organized of them, to secure their own private spaces on the meteor. Especially considering their hasty getaway, which was forced by a crisis. Maybe trolls have such a strong instinctive sense of private space, groups of trolls always do this any time they find a new space to commonly settle into? It would make sense, since they all grow up solo in their own very personalized hives. Yeah, let's say that's the explanation for this ridiculous feature of this game map.\n\nNow it's Karkat's turn. Again, while playing the game, you can do a lot of this in any order you want. This particular sequence is just how the material is being presented here in the book. Karkat seems like the best one to save for last. Ultimately, it's totally up to the player to decide when to move on and click the link to the next page. They can glean as much or as little from the game as they want, with no particular milestones to clear before being allowed to advance. Perhaps this is a double-edged sword, storytelling-wise. But there aren't many other ways to handle it in such a mixed-media environment.\n\n(scene omitted from screenshots) Recall that the Sassacre tome was touted as being thick enough to kill someone (or a cat, specifically), which foreshadowed the fact that it did literally kill someone (Nanna), and also literally did kill a cat specifically as well. We're getting a similar line here. It isn't quite used as a blunt instrument to kill someone exactly. But Doc Scratch does end up using it to put a pretty good beatdown on Spades Slick.\n\nFinally Karkat enters the same ectobiology lab he used to make paradox clones of himself and all his friends, just like John did. Also just like John did, Karkat appears to have created twice as many infants as might be expected. We know that John created their guardians as well, who are all true paradox clones (genetic copies of themselves, and themselves alone paradoxically, and therefore not related to each other). And then all their slime was mixed to create the kids, who are sibling pairs (Jake + Jane = John and Jade. Dirk + Roxy = Dave and Rose.) So this leads us to expect something similar happened here, especially now that we see two identical sets of twelve jars. Except, due to the way trolls breed, they don't have parent pairs, so their slime wasn't mixed that way. They're created through an \"incestuous slurry,\" which implies all the slime is mixed together and results in each troll individually. It seems this process happened twice, once for the trolls we know, and then again for all their ancestors, who seem to be, if not exact copies, extremely close genetic copies of their descendants.\n\n>47 We flash back to the moment he activated the cloning machine, and see him swarmed by freshly spawned grubs. Now the question is, are these his baby friends, or their ancestors? Which spawned first? It probably doesn't matter, since they're so similar. Whichever it was, the other group came next, but that's not shown here, because we're not diving into the ancestor stuff just yet at this point of the story. But that second array of 12 jars certainly starts putting the idea in our heads. It's probably the first concrete evidence that the ancestors are going to be a real thing in the story, rather than something vaguely alluded to as background lore during the Hivebent worldbuilding gauntlet. If you're perceptive, you stick this observation in your back pocket, and wait for the issue to come up again. And it does. Later in A5A2, when the dramatic arcs of all these trolls as a friend group start coming to a head, the introduction of all the ancestors as characters (see: Mindfang Diaries) mainly serves as a way of broadening those arcs to function as conclusions to these sort of long-running karmic destinies originally established by their legendary progenitors. Those backstories do a lot more than that too, including expanding on Alternian lore a little more, as well as establishing yet another roster of intensely beloved fan favorites with a few quick story strokes. Quick in page count, albeit kinda wordy (thanks, Aranea).\n\nAaaaaand that's the last page of the game. On this adorable note of ancestor-descendant ambiguity, let's move on. At the end of the day, it was only 150 pages or so, right? It's not like anybody else was gonna do something better with that paper.\n\n>48 The meteor has little puzzles to solve. Don't ask why. It's a game. And not one you're playing alone. They're playing it too. At some point Karkat actually did have to journey through this meteor as a Sgrub objective to create all their baby grubs in the first place, through ectobiology. So yeah, he probably had to do menial things like pushing clone jars on to special tiles to unlock doors, while hating every minute of it.\n\n>49 That was a lot of consecutive pages without notes, involving a mostly uneventful transit through Terezi's private section of the map. Maybe this makes it seem like this game's map involves a gratuitous sprawl that mostly serves as a gameplay time sink, to flesh out the environmental color. But I think more is being established here in a fairly efficient way, giving us a good sense of the space and layout of this meteor setting, which will become one of the most Significantly revisited places in the story. Here's a location in the meteor being established now, a place where Terezi makes chalk drawings on the wall. Later she adds to these drawings after befriending Dave. And much later, when Dave himself is on this meteor, they start drawing on the walls together, while the Mayor works on Can Town. Many locations you pass through in this game are revisited later as callbacks, and if you're on the ball, you'll remember them when you see them.\n\nHere's how these timeline anchor points help us get our bearings. Terezi smells the remnants of Prospit, which recently blew up. So in a couple pages, when we time-skip ahead to her smelling the remains of Derse, we'll have a pretty good sense of where we are in the story.\n\nThe empty chest that you may fill in the future is just a time-hop transition trick, to bring us to...\n\n>50 ...the death of Derse, pinning us down about three hours in the future. A lot has happened in those three hours. Now, through the power of this flash-forward, we get to backtrack through Terezi's lair and get a sense of what the developments have been.\n\nThe empty chest transition device is also being used for a little wardrobe change, to help visually distinguish between the Terezi from this time period and the Terezi from the past we just got done controlling. If we ever see Dragon Suit Terezi in future panels, it can be used as another bit of guidance regarding where to put her on the timeline.\n\nThree hours later, the full-blown Davening of Terezi is well underway. My feeling has always been that there are just certain types of people with specific personalities who were born to be diehard fans of SBaHJ. Terezi is clearly one of them.\n\n>51 Nepeta's hangin' out in the radial transporter array room for some reason. She's here to show you a cool secret. It's very exciting.\n\n(scene ommitted from screenshots) This is kind of a standard RPG secret format. You look for vulnerabilities in the wall, and sometimes certain spots are permeable, which lead you to hidden rooms. But I don't think you were allowed to find this secret until Nepeta led the way, if I recall.\n\nEarlier, Eridan made some reference to being more discreet with his pile of wands than Gamzee is with his pile of horns. Like it's shameful contraband that a guy should keep tucked away rather than letting it all hang out in the open like a shameless clown. So Nepeta's helped us stumble on Eridan's stash. Is nothing sacred???\n\nWe switch back to Past Terezi before reentering the computer lab. Walking around and talking to people in the lab in the three hours in the future would expose too much info for now. We've had enough of a taste.\n\n>52 Vriska is the Thief of Light. So she literally steals his luck, and gives it to herself. This makes it much more likely something bad will happen to him, all on its own.\n\nLike this. He falls in a pit, and that's the end of this guy forever. Take a note of this pit she just created, though. Remember the context and the shape of those jagged edges. This precipitous venue comes back into play during a critical showdown with Tavros, wherein dramatic happenings take place. (FYI: she just throws the dude off another fuckin' cliff.)\n\n>53 (first portion not shown) The items are a bit ridiculous. Finding them in chests serves no purpose at all, except to sort of amusingly emulate the feel of playing an RPG. Otherwise there's very little logic to it. Why wouldn't she keep her dice on her all the time? Especially since a sylladex allows you to do this very easily, without feeling encumbered. The answer is, these are all completely ridiculous people who like to hoard things in their secret, locked-away parts of the meteor, especially the ones who have a flair for treasure and the hunting thereof. Bear in mind that Vriska originally found her cool dice in a chest on a ship. Maybe she just likes to relive the magic of that experience now and then?\n\nSpeaking of treasure, here's her secret pirate's trove. Which, yes, due to inflation is now completely worthless. But it was already worthless, since she was never going to use it to buy anything ever again anyway. Let's try to imagine how much more money Terezi has than this now. If this is the size of Vriska's stockpile, then Terezi's would be...the size of the sun? Bigger? Probably bigger. No wonder Vriska's steamed. Time to spend the rest of the act radically overcompensating.\n\nW...wow?\n\nMore Strong Content.\n\n>54 In the future I guess Vriska cleans out her whole supply of boondollars. I forget what happened... Possibly she gives it all to John to help him compete with Dave? That sounds about right, even if it's not. Let's just say it is. I believe this time hop forward triggers some poignant music, because she's about to express her undying love for Nic Cage again.\n\nVriska has stashed a dreamy Cage bust away in here, understandably. And also...a salamander? Okay. I guess she...kidnapped one? Again, let's remind ourselves we aren't allowed to question anything Vriska does. It's totally fine she trapped a helpless salamander in this chest for many hours.\n\nVriska's Cage Shrine is where she goes to be alone with her most private thoughts, and to put in some good swooning time over her main boy, Nic. Examining the wall triggers this...I'm not sure what it is. Some half-assed Flash garbage jittering about. Nic Cage, in terms of the mythological language and symbolism native to Homestuck, conforms to the archetype of \"Human Shitpost.\""

It seems innocent and all in good fun, but really, this is just plain fucking unnecessary. Once we get to know Jane better, in certain ways I think it starts to reveal there are facets to Nanna's character that cast some of her habits in a less charitable light. She was groomed to be the heiress of Betty Crocker, a.k.a. the Condesce, after all, in both this timeline and the post-scratch one. She broke free from Condy at a younger age to run her own joke shop but possibly still retained some dubious habits from that questionable upbringing. The full range of post-scratch Jane's arc reveals some dark thoughts and tendencies as well. Is it possible the simplest explanation is...deep down, she's just kind of a shithead?? It's more likely than you might think. Not to piss on anyone's good time if you like Jane or Nanna, though. At this point in the story, she easily exists in the sphere of \"kindly, archetypical grandmother,\" who is a bit feisty but still only wishes to help.

Also, looks like Eridan is chatting up Rose, as the previous game implied he would. But I think we can completely ignore that in favor of this art style topic, because it's more interesting, and also, Eridan sucks. I think shortly after I started rolling out weird drawings like this, someone asked me what I called the style, and I replied by naming it \"Hussnasty Mode\" myself, because well. ..it's a bit nasty, isn't it? Kind of raw, a little over-illustrated, and making use of a lot of jagged aliased pixel edges for a hatching-type effect. It was sort of the point to make it a little nasty, kind of aggressively incongruous with the other styles previously established. It is here that I will invoke a concept that I feel was incredibly important to the ongoing production of Homestuck, which I will call a \"creative power move.\" But before I go off the deep end about all that, it's important to note that drawings like this are introduced in contrast with this simple RPG sprite mode, which was also established very recently as something that Homestuck was \"allowed\" to use as a stylistic presentation of characters and settings. That's partly the point here. That every time HS does something like this, it's widening its own umbrella in terms of what it's allowed to do stylistically, which includes dramatically simplifying and abstracting its forms. Which implicitly asks another question: Can HS \"allow\" itself to go in the other direction? To render characters with higher degrees of definition, regardless of congruity, and freely navigate this full artistic palette at any time, resulting in sharp stylistic contrast and a certain amount of visual thrashing? The answer to that question, almost immediately after it's asked in the form of dropping RPG-sprite Rose into a standard panel shot, is yes, HS can do that, and clearly it WILL do that. -->"

Sometimes they come off as really overt or aggressive, as this one somewhat does. There are a few others that probably qualify, like reprinting the entire troll romance spiel, Trickster Mode, and almost all of Caliborn's submissions. Perhaps the troll pirate erotica too? I'm sure we could name more examples if we put our heads together. There are more tame or friendly examples, such as, \"Hey, guess what? Today HS gets to be a playable RPG game out of nowhere, and you didn't know it could do that.\" Anything that pushes the envelope, challenges people, keeps them on their toes and reminds them this is neither a safe nor static enterprise. People get very comfortable with art they enjoy, particularly if it's an ongoing, regularly delivered product that lets them settle into rhythms of expectation. It starts to feel like \"theirs\" in some ways. The favorable experience is taking place inside them, after all, so they feel like that experience belongs to them. Which is fair. Such is human nature, to start instinctively building a possessive relationship with the art we enjoy. But as much as it feels this way, it simply can never be entirely true. There is the way the reader wants the work to be, as dictated by the special feelings of fondness for what they're already familiar with, and there is the way the artist wants the work to be, as an expression of their ever-evolving vision, which can include anything. So any time I felt that certain people were getting overly comfortable with the way they assumed the story needed to be, whether it was the format, narrative structure, or art style, these little power moves were deployed as a means of \"pushing back\" against those forces. It's a way to make frequent statements on the media's versatility, but it also turned out to be a very effective innoculation against too many people getting those overly comfortable, presumptuous feelings about what this story \"needs\" to be in the first place. -->"

Like jarring whiplash effects, or the risk of untethering the media from previously established rhythms of coherence (to whatever extent that coherence even really existed in the first place). In short, it can make things feel just a little bit Weird. But my take on that was always that it's okay, because that's explicitly what we've always been doing here: getting a bit weird with media, staying almost pathologically loose about everything, and making the best of the situation. The next fifteen book pages are where most of the dabbling with this style took place, using the story itself as a live canvas for messing around with it. I virtually never did any sketch testing of any sort outside of the comic. The comic itself always was the drafting process, in a totally transparent way, which was a policy that kept it rolling out FAST. Some of these drawings feel pretty out of control, a bit uncanny when juxtaposed with the other styles. But some seemed to strike a nicer balance, like the panel on the upper right, or the one where Rose talks to Jaspersprite in a few pages. If I used this style more, I probably would have gravitated toward whatever style variant felt most successful from this stretch of panel studies. But the fact is, I mostly discontinued it after this, with only a few exceptions here and there. The main reason was that, even with the more successful panels, it just felt like it added too much drawing time to the update process. The goal wasn't just to try new, crazy things, it was also to balance that with whatever sequential art methods could be done REALLY FAST, in a sustainable way. Slowing down to overly render a face with a lot of wild, aliased hatching wasn't really the best visual trade-off for the time investment, so it kind of dropped out of the comic's toolkit. -->"

I don't know if that's scanning in an obvious way now, and TBH it was a long time ago, so I'm not sure to what extent I was hoping it would. Anyway, that's a pretty strange facial rendering that this graphic freestyling has resulted in. Stuff like this is plunging us about as deep into the uncanny part of the visual curve that the story ever allows us to go. Which is probably for the best, as is the fact that it pulls way back from this style pretty soon. But pushing it this far really hammers it home as a power move, because there's no way you can come away from this style sequence and conclude that the artist gives the slightest fuck about the various measures of formalism and consistency that you might wish he would abide by to optimize the reader experience. Creative power moves that essentially send the signal, \"I just don't give a fuck about ___, and you can't make me,\" have a twofold consequence. First, it helps regulate the attitudes of those inclined to enforce such principles of formalism, by sort of preempting the inclination for such people to even regard it as a problem. Second, as an extension of that attitude-shaping effect, it forces people to focus on what the artist intends as the most important aspects of the work. Showing the visuals as this chaotic variable send the message that, \"The specific visual presentations are not that important, and things exist on such a layer of abstraction that specific visuals may not convey anything that concrete at all, except a hypothetical expression of certain underlying platonic ideals functioning as the story's basic units.\" Which then forces you to focus on the elements which are noticeably NON-variable, like the nature of the dialogue, the focus on characterization and profile building, the examination of certain ideas and themes. All kinds of stuff that has no intersection with adherence to formalistic patterns that are designed to make readers more comfortable with their favorite serialized entertainment product. -->"

They're probably pretty funny, but there's a threshold of frivolity that a bunch of silly RP shit just fails to rise above, despite HS generally having no problem indulging in other kinds of frivolity. In other words, they're that pointless. So part of the gag here is, clearly Rose has talked to Nepeta. The subtext is that Nepeta may have even badgered her so frequently, asking if she could talk to Jaspers, that Rose plays it sarcastically, as if she can't imagine why Nepeta is bugging her again. Come to think of it, this is a clear precursor to the same running gag with Fefeta, which is dialed up to a greater extreme. She barely ever says a word in the comic, but everyone around her keeps implying that she won't shut up."

I think it's just that we're getting down to something really basic and resonant here: the simple relationship between a girl and her cat, and the pure, uncomplicated love they have for each other. Too bad all of Homestuck couldn't be like this. Maybe then people wouldn't think I'm some sort of deranged asshole. Ah, what could have been. More plot-relatedly, Jaspers throws out some more stuff on Rose's quest for her to consider, and kind of nags her to do it. I've already talked a lot about Rose's peculiar upside-down arc. This is another one of those things that makes it feel like this quest is narratively what is demanded of her, which is the point. That it's supposed to feel that way to her, and has a strange sense of obligatory gravity surrounding it.

But it's laying the groundwork for the radically game-changing Murderstuck arc coming up soon (not in this book though). I feel some obligation to keep reminding you of this now and then: LITERALLY NO ONE SAW THIS COMING. Not even one person, as far as I could tell. I spent every day scouring reactions online to all this. I guess the idea was too patently dumb? I feel like I use that to my advantage a lot. Like, \"There's no way that will happen, it would be just too dumb.\" Sorry, suckers. Nothing is ever off the table.\n\nUp until his true aspect is revealed, Gamzee remains affectionately, or perhaps repugnantly, known as the Bard of Fuck. His true aspect, Rage, couldn't be revealed until the time was right, because it's pretty close to being a spoiler as to his true nature. Gamzee says his mind's not sharp because it's been ages since he had a pie (i.e. sopor slime). Which some readers took as implying that his withdrawal from this drug is what unleashed his violent tendencies. Hence murderous Gamzee often is fanonically referred to as \"Sober Gamzee.\" And there is probably some truth to this, that without the sedative influence of the slime, he's naturally inclined toward violence. But I think the best explanation for Gamzee's turn is what Dave is about to do here: link him to a \"Miracles\" video by the Insane Clown Posse. For reasons I'll get into on the next page, I think this has a lot more to do with his transformation. Dave also boggles over why Alternia has Faygo and how that makes no sense. But we now know it makes perfect sense. It's not even remotely challenging to connect the dots. Faygo was imported to Earth by the Condesce, so as to foster her own home-grown, human-based cult of nasty clowns (ICP, and juggalos in general). She did the same thing with her own favorite soda, Tab."

WHY THOUGH??? /Dusts off my lectern and assumes professorial demeanor./ Gamzee is the \"Juggalo Troll.\" If you already knew about ICP and juggalos, then his first conversation made it so glaringly obvious, it was almost impossible not to groan in recognition of this fact. The process of creating twelve trolls, each of whom embody satirical themes spoofing subcultures and various controversial internet profiles, was kind of a tall order, and it involved a bit of grasping at straws to fill out the group. The \"Juggalo Troll\" probably was the most egregious example of me saying, \"Fuck it, we're just running with a really dumb idea here, and that's fine, because it's funny.\" So Gamzee's entire identity, and all characterization and points of lore surrounding him, including his absurd religion, is grounded in an especially stupid joke, even by Homestuck standards. So this is why being introduced to ICP finally makes him snap: it represents a collision between this satirical avatar, the fictional embodiment of this complete joke of an idea, and the fourth wall—breaking exposure to the very content he was designed to mock. On some level Gamzee understands that he's been forced to confront the fact that his entire existence is a joke. He was designed to ridicule that which he reveres. So he just fucking loses it and is never really the same guy again. It's almost a kind of dark, clowny enlightenment, an achievement of chaotic self-awareness. He quite effectively harnesses this grudge by getting revenge on the very story that created him for such humiliating satirical purposes. His method of revenge is linked to Caliborn's modus operandi (whom he comes to revere as the true godhead of his religious beliefs), which is to degrade and defile the story he inhabits. Gamzee's influence appears to be arbitrary, always occuring at the exact right (wrong) moment, to do the exact thing that will fuck things up in a totally incomprehensible way. He becomes an agent of plot chaos, of narrative entropy, and achieves a certain zen in the loathsome, capricious role he plays in the story. These tendencies are linked to his aspect, and could be seen as a certain mastery of it. Make no mistake: Gamzee sucks. He is, on a conventional layer, a \"bad character.\" His personality is unpleasant, his actions are repellant, and his presence is always an affront to good taste and judgment. Yet, in my view, it's hard to avoid another conclusion that seems to contradict these awful truths about him: there are some potent themes and ideas governing his existence as a character, his actions, and the reasoning behind his dark turn."

Hold on while I make my own struggling body pass out through a chokehold wrestling move, so I'll shut up for half a second, and talk about this great Dave/Equius conversation. This is a really good one, both for the quality of the ensuing rap-off, and the lore pertaining to Dave's quest sprinkled in here. It's another one of these presentations like when Rose was ripping apart the ruins to expose the Green Sun portion underneath, which was passively backgrounded as an idle point of curiosity, while the entertaining character interaction was foregrounded as the more relevant focus. I'd say Dave's quest lore here is treated as a little more important than that was, since the Dave-Equius relationship isn't actually as relevant as Rosemary's development, and this is pretty much the only time they ever talk. But it's still a good example of: foreground = fun, whimsical character driven banter; background = \"important,\" interesting game lore and worldbuilding. Remember what I said about how the consistencies in art reveal what's important. This approach to storytelling is consistently embraced, even while the art style is overtly inconsistent.\n\nEquius accuses Dave of \"verbal misdire%ion and hoofbeastplay,\" but then he goes on to claim that he's not much of a poet. Which is a TOTAL LIE. His slam poetry is incredible. Also the conversation almost immediately veers in a homoerotic direction, due to Dave's frequent habit of using gay innuendo to own his targets, combined with Equius's habit of urgently insisting that others get assertive with him, making almost no effort to disguise the fetishistic nature of the demand. There are yaoi fires being stoked here in a completely plausible way. If Karkat had died, and Equius had survived instead, there's a decent chance things could have worked out a lot differently between these two."

He cites said abuse in the text above, in case there's any doubt this issue has been inseparably woven into the lore of his arc at an early stage. There's a lot to say about the broken sword as a symbol. I've probably already touched on it in earlier books. But what fucking good am I down here if I'm not willing to repeat myself? It's a complex symbol. First, there are two symbolic modes, an \"Unbroken Sword\" and a \"Broken Sword,\" which have meaning in relation to each other. The simplest translation is that the unbroken sword is \"The fully manifest, wholly embraced heroic arc. Suppressing reservations, answering the call, putting the tough training to use, despite the cost to oneself.\" Versus the broken sword, which is \"The fractured heroic arc. An incomplete, broken self stemming from past trauma. A conflicted semi-refusal of the call, resulting in pursuit of combat and quest-fulfillment navigated through half-measure, wavering resolve, and compromised investment.\" Only one of these symbols can be fully embraced, and it means something to embrace one over the other. It becomes a statement Dave is making about himself, and the type of person he wants to be. But the statement has to be understood by him to be meaningful, and this understanding comes through his long-term inner reflections over his arc. The game also seems to provide frequent clues to help him understand these symbols and choices. It keeps offering up broken swords, or more specifically, a whole sword that can only be obtained by figuring out how to break it. -->"

Now, what will you do with it?\" In the long run, this sword-based Sburb quest does appear to have a formal endpoint, which is Dave using this sword to have his denizen forge the Royal Deringer, a much fancier mythical sword. And in forging that sword, he \"heals\" it, converting it to an unbroken sword symbol. Heroic arc, back on track, right? Except to wield that sword, Dave has to break it too, simply by touching it, as if his identity being linked to a broken sword is inescapable. There are ways of reading into what this means. Maybe it's that making yourself whole as a person isn't so simple? Maybe it's that Dave embracing the broken sword as his heroic talisman corresponds with his embracing who he is as person, flaws and all? Those things aren't going away, and they contribute to making him who he is. Similar to Rose's arc, which is more about embracing her imperfect sense of humanity rather than satisfying an external sense of obligation that includes the false promise of repairing the flaws of a damaged person through a path of shallow narrative regimentation. There are echoes of \"two people who can't be fixed, and that's okay\" in each other's arcs, but a lot of differences in the way their respective roads are paved to reach the destination. -->"

SBaHJ comics, and other creations of this nature, draw from a deep reservoir of highly perceptive apprehension of one's own condition, as well as others. What else to say about the matter of Dave's sword arc? Probably lots, but there's plenty more material in future books to obsess over down here. There's one other thing that springs to mind about the sword as a symbol, taking into consideration that a lot of these symbols are pretty multi-faceted and have ways of going through transformative evolutions as the story progresses. As a clue, look at the solution to this \"sword in the stone\" puzzle, and how unconventional it is relative to the original myth. It's reckless, destructive, a speedy end run around a situation that traditionally demands finesse or divine providence. So the broken sword doubly serves as a symbol for Dave's approach to this heroic journey, which isn't one he chose. (Rose blazed the trail of this destructive path, which then anchored the whole group to it via forces of predestination.) In other words, the solution to the sword puzzle was built to demand a hack. It's a microcosm for the solution to everything in this session, and the wav the kids are destined to play it. Nobody is playing this thing totally straight.\n\nEarlier I was pointing out how Daverezi had the air of someone (Terezi) finding a new person (Dave) to rebound with who seems fun and refreshing in the ways that contrasted with an aggravating ex. But then, after spending a little more time with Dave, she starts pointing out some Similarities to Karkat, as if to note that maybe they aren't so dissimilar after all. Ain't that the way it is for some people, with their dating track record tracing a line through a whole bunch of guys who just end up being variations on the same basic type of guy. On the other hand, like she says here, she's sort of exaggerating these commonalities, perhaps to continue owning Dave, or maybe in a way, to own herself. There's a shadow consequence in pointing out the similarities between Dave and Karkat, which is beginning to pave the very long road that ends up in the heart of Davekat City. I'm not pretending that was \"the plan\" at this moment. God, what sort of bullshit artist do you take me for????? But establishing foundational similarities in their profiles, in the struggles they have with themselves, provides for a much stronger base compatibility, which makes the outcome more likely (and also welcome, to many). So what are their similarities? Terezi goes so far as to list some of them here. Could she actually be the first Davekat shipper ever, even as she actively courts Dave herself? Wow. I just blew my own mind, and yours. Let's consider Terezi an allegorical figure for the Daverezi shippers of this era, who would eventually turn out to be Davekat shippers, without having the slightest clue they were Davekat stans all along."

This final conversation between Dave and Davesprite is decent, and serves a good purpose, but that's all we really need from their direct interaction anymore.

Kind of an audio-visual nightmare, with an obnoxiously escalating wall of noise. Probably a decent cinematic comparison would be when Willy Wonka took everybody through his weird tunnel of psychotic lunacy for some reason.\n\nBut as you can see, it all starts out pretty nice. Jade first imagines she sees a candy-coated version of this disturbing eldritch abyss. Literally: it's a Trickster facade. Squiddles canonically are known to be Trickster Horrorterrors. A perception of the beasts that is friendlier and more comprehensible to mortal minds. The illusion doesn't last long, though.\n\nThis is probably the first visual indication that the concept of dream bubbles exists. They don't usually look like this one, which is a low-fi pixel bubble in keeping with the fantasy it projects inside for Jade. Horrorterrors blow these bubbles, each of which serves as a little phantasmal oasis floating freely through the infinite, existentially unforgiving desert of the Furthest Ring. They stabilize a temporary realm of illusion for mortals to exist in without having to engage with the eldritch abominations just outside or the bleak expanse in which they live. So this is establishing the foundational basis for the afterlife in Paradox Space—not an eternal continuum like heaven or hell, but a purgatory of a more dubious nature, one that is actively maintained by vast, ancient monsters through a network of trillions of relatively small ephemeral bubbles. They pop, they get blown again, ghosts can drift freely from one to another. When we understand the broader cosmology of Paradox Space in this way, it starts to seem reasonable to begin thinking in terms of \"bubble-based reality structures,\" which means that Sburb sessions freely floating through the abyss could also be seen as a kind of bubble. But a very special kind, which has the nucleus of Skaia in the middle, and thus is endowed with this all-knowing spark that can beget a stable, physical existence contained within a universe the players create inside of it. Do horrorterrors blow these bubbles too? IT IS UNCLEAR.\n\nThis animation, aside from accomplishing the worthy goal of totally freaking everyone out, also serves the purpose of acquainting everyone more closely with the existence of horrorterrors and their greater relevance to the cosmos and the story. Dave was recently urged to take his glasses off, and also to try listening to these beasts and see what they have to say to him. This is the \"boon\" which Derse dreamers have, and which Prospit dreamers don't. On Prospit, you have access to Skaia and all its cloud visions. On Derse, you have access to the grumblings of these distant monsters. Great consolation prize, huh? Skaia can inform Prospit kids what they need to do, and Jade enthusiastically embraces its counsel. But horrorterrors can somewhat play the same role, and provide mysterious instructions to both Rose and Dave that they have to parse. Their murmurings to Dave here carry a message of urgency, as he'll say later, and this starts laying the intel groundwork for the melodramatic suicide mission hatched later. Also, this shot confirms Dave's eye color pretty unambiguously, continuing a trend in the story where this very specific piece of info gets confirmed for each character, beginning with that strangely over-detailed portrait of Rose. For whatever odd visual thrashing that style added to the story, one thing it definitely established was the story's ability to focus with much greater granularity on the presentation of characters who for the most part are only \"ideas\" of people. Their abstracted presentation usually tends to communicate that \"This is just an idea of a character, for whom many specific attributes are vague or variable.\" But by intensifying the presentation, and then highlighting it with one notable point of specificity, we can come away with some confidence that Rose's eyes are literally meant to be purple, rather than it just being another stylistic tick. Having established that, I think we can safely do the same for Dave here, even without the overly intensive rendering style.\n\nIt's hard to even really describe what's going on with this page without the weird music that everything plays off of. Nothing is really going on with it? Hey, here's an idea, let's just ignore this page and move on. There's Feferi over there. She's worth talking about, right?\n\nRemember that Feferi is presently grimnapping. \"Presently\" doesn't mean much, because the timelines are out of whack relative to each other, but \"presently\" from the STORY'S perspective usually does mean something. Remember the conversation Eridan just had with Rose, where she blew up his computer, and I ignored the conversation to talk about something else because he sucks and who cares about him? Well, I still stand by that decision, he sucks and who cares. But there was another purpose served by showing that conversation at that moment. \"Eridan's computer explodes\" is one of those key moments on the troll timeline we took note of during the recent RPG game. And linked to that moment is Feferi's dark nap. You could see her in the panel there near Eridan, sleeping on the horn pile, with a dark bubble over her. This reminds us that's what she's doing \"now,\" just like Jade, and here they are, rendezvousing in this freaky dream bubble. Which, if there's one really important role Feferi plays, it's this: establishing \"first contact\" between trolls and humans through the dream realm, a.k.a. the afterlife. Feferi is quite chipper about it all and wants everyone to know there's nothing to worry about. That's pretty easy for her to say, though, since her mom is one of these monsters. But then, maybe that's how she knows they really aren't as bad as they seem.\n\nOkay, see, this thing with THIS page is, um...the really IMPORTANT point to make would be, uhhhhhhhhhhhhh. All right, you got me. There's nothing to say here. The thing about this animation is, for all the story-relevant things I've been saying about it, it's also just kind of a big shitpost.\n\nWhat's really going on is the bubble-based illusion is starting to unravel, and then insanity ensues. Jade is worried, Feferi isn't. She's just completely unflappable when it comes to this eldritch bullshit.\n\nThere's a moment in the song that makes it clear something is now very, very wrong. That's where we're at.\n\nProbably the best way of looking at this in a non-abstract way is, this is the moment when Jade and Feferi's shared dream bubble pops. The illusion is over, and now their dream ghost projection-forms are hurtling freely through the abyss at great speed, before their phantom bodies (another weird concept in Homestuck that probably bears elaboration on, but much later) start to dissolve outside of the confining environment of the bubble that keeps them stable, causing them to wake up.\n\nThen we go nighttime dumpster diving in the alley behind a bargain seafood restaurant. I mean, no we don't, this is all scary and serious and stuff. But there is sort of a running gag later where Dave and maybe some other people keep referring to these things humorously in terms of seafood analogies. But of course you don't eat these things, they eat YOU. Okay, that probably isn't true either. Although they do have huge, nasty mouths, as you can see. Which makes you wonder, what do they eat? What's even out there in the void? Smaller horrorterrors? That's probably it. There's likely just an entire diverse ecology of horrorterrors, with smaller ones very plentiful and larger ones more scarce, to keep the food chain balanced. Other than that, it's a complete free for all. I'm just literally making all this shit up right now, if it wasn't clear.\n\nI said in an earlier book that these eldritch beasts were only imported into Homestuck because of their presence in Problem Sleuth, which used them in a much goofier way. It didn't really take their horrifying nature or the Lovecraftian tradition of them seriously at all. But the way HS starts blending them into its greater cosmology does seem to take them a little more seriously as literary devices from the horror genre. I never read any Lovecraft and don't really care about these creatures in respect to them being specific elements of his work. They were siphoned into the PS/HS lore from the wider pop-culture melange that has elevated the notion of an eldritch abomination into something transcending the original source material to become a more widely recognized fantasy trope. So this is the nature of their utility here, something touching on a more universal principle of alien horror which says that some alien life is so unfathomable and unsettling to us that even contemplating them is a gateway to madness. Neither good nor evil, their existence utterly eludes definition or judgment on mortal humanoid terms. They rule the infinite expanse of the Furthest Ring, where seemingly no other form of life exists except for them. And corporeal life as we understand it exists within this medium as a tiny subset of its total volume. It's implied, as I mentioned a few notes ago, that all comprehensible realities to us (such as dream bubble illusions, or Sburb sessions containing entire universes) actually are confined by little bubbles that these beasts whimsically blow, probably for no humanly comprehensible reason. This suggests that this godawful abyss and its gruesome inhabitants are the default reality. And the much more stable, relatable realms we enjoy, such as \"a universe,\" are actually the rare exceptions: totally anomalous, dreamlike fields of experience that exist only briefly relative to the lifespan of these monsters, as the confining bubbles swell and pop.\n\nThis animation finally crescendos at the moment when you begin to think you can't take another goddamn second on Wonka's shitty boat. And then everything is okay. Except not really, because we float by one more awful monster, which has been wonderfully illustrated to make sure you realize, under particular rendering conditions, that these aren't all just a bunch of cartoon goofballs, but actually super-duper grotesque and scary entities.\n\nGood thing Jade's dream ghost projection-whatever is \"sleeping\" soundly through all this, otherwise she'd probably be really scared if she saw that thing. Except this rendering probably isn't literal? It might be a shot of what she's seeing through her mind's eye as she sleeps. In which case she is really scared right now. But it's fine, Feferi will reassure her and tell her all these space monsters are actually great. Some of her best friends are space monsters. Her MOM was a space monster. Don't be a bigot, Jade.\n\nJade finally wakes up. She went to sleep at some point in Act 4. It's tricky to pin down exactly when she fell asleep by casually skimming through the archive, but she's been asleep for well over 1,000 site pages. This is the nature of Jade's role in the story. She spends huge amounts of time being asleep, or compromised in some way, like being brainwashed. At one point, she even gets put to sleep while being brainwashed. But for now, she's finally awake and ready to play a more active role in the story. Her relevance starts snowballing from here and peaks during [S] Cascade, i.e. the midpoint of the story. I probably said this before, but the shape of her arc is a huge bell curve, rising slowly from the fog of her sleepy marginalization, peaking right in the middle, then gradually tapering back off as she starts getting compromised in different ways. Everyone's views on this may vary, but I always thought that for a story with a big ensemble cast, it was more interesting to have a wide variety of arcs of different shapes, sizes, focal points, themes, and peak moments, rather than somewhat artificially trying to make sure all the major players' arcs peak right around the same time at the very end. This aspect is a little bit underscored by what Jade does in [S] Collide. Her role there isn't about kicking ass, it's about having fun. And then, finally, about getting punched in the face for One Last Nap."

It's all right, Fef, I was never sure which exact nomenclature to settle on when describing this dream ghost shit either. It's been a long time since we've checked in with Jade. She has a lot to catch up on here. Including the highly tragic destruction of Prospit, which was a beloved second home to her. Jade has always been a very cheerful, carefree kid up to this point. When she wakes up here, it seems to mark a new chapter in her life and a different evolution in her personality. One wherein she must finally confront \"actual adversity.\"\n\nFull disclosure: I just do not enjoy Feferi's quirk. I never have. The parentheses are annoying, and it's especially annoying how they get separated when they straddle a line break. Whenever someone contrives an excuse for her to stop using it (when she \"gets real\" with Eridan and drops it, or when Jade says it's giving her a headache), that's 100% me going, \"Meh, I'm not feeling this quirk, time to drop it for a bit.\" Jade is me here. Thanks for asking her for me, Jade, I owe you one. Oh, you don't want to be punched in the face at the end of Homestuck? Let's not get fucking greedy here. Anyway, Jade reminds us about how Karkat used her dreambot exploding as a critical event for her to use as a reminder for Jade to message him. So now she's about to do that, cashing in that plot token. Very satisfying. As events get more convoluted, the characters all need to come up with different strategies for how to devise reminders and signals that will serve their communication purposes. Advanced reminders, unlike the simplistic, childlike reminders Jade wears on her fingers, which she is about to abandon for good in a few pages."

She does all her buddies the service of almost completely taking over Karkat's duties for practically the rest of the session. Maybe not consciously exactly, but he seems to latch on to her in lieu of bothering John after getting romantically rebuffed by him and making a fool of himself backwards through time. Jade is fresh meat for semi-amorous harassment, though he has to do a fair amount of repair work to get the ball rolling again after belligerently sliding into her DMS for years in the past, during the more reckless phases of his trolling binge. Jade's an easy mark for such a recovery though, since even though she's a grumpy bitch at the moment, she's still pretty nice and likes making friends. Final observation: the above panel I think is a pretty good hybrid style of all these flailing presentations over the last few pages. We went from Sprite Mode, to a Sprite-Hero Hybrid Mode, to some sort of Hussnasty Lite Mode, and now this one, which seems to blend them all in a decent way. This would be another one of these unusual art style candidates where I'd be inclined to say, if the whole thing were done in this style alone, that would result in a pretty solid piece of work.\n\nWhen two kids formerly at each other's throats start working on becoming better friends, it helps for them to establish some stuff to bond over. Jade just bonded with Feferi over having a dead dream self and taking a very disturbing nap as a result. And now Jade and Karkat get to do the same thing, only it's probably a more effective bonding topic since, unlike Feferi, they both hated the experience. Or rather, this should be a good bonding topic, but here Karkat is, fucking blowing it with her again, because he just can't help himself. Of course, I don't really have to excoriate him for his thoughtless handling of the situation. He's about to give Future Karkat an opportunity to do that to himself. He is a Knight, after all. And one way he apparently decides to utilize his class is by white knighting on behalf of aggrieved damsels against his own earlier trolling efforts. Quite valorous, really."

Even though his future self is the one who arranged Jade and Karkat to connect this way in the first place, so as to send them on a path toward friendship. Future Karkat almost seems to deliberately give his past self enough conversational rope to hang himself with, buying enough time for Jade to say something that triggers Karkat so hard that he launches into one of his \"I AM YOUR GOD!\" tirades. Which by now we should know is a romantically coded message, because that's how he introduced himself to John before he proceeded to spadeflirt with him. Basically, Jade has barely been awake for a few minutes and she's already lunging headlong through the hormone-slicked slalom of interspecies romance. Welcome to the party, Harley.\n\nAnd just like that, the moment Future Karkat steps in, practically the entire page of dialogue turns to gray. Nobody can get a word in edgewise between these two. Their unrestrained auto-invective basically renders Karkat's neuroses totally apparent for Jade to marvel over. The consequences of this are hard to even fully keep track of. First, by defending Jade like this, Future Karkat is virtually making the case to his own past self to give her a chance, and to try to acknowledge that his aggression toward her is masking romantic attraction. If that wasn't nuts enough, the altercation doubles as an actual confession of this to Jade, which she now has to bear in mind as she goes forward befriending this guy. Like most other shouting matches Karkat has with himself, it's a complete free-for-all of self-owns and eyebrow-raising psychological revelations. And yet, in the totality of this clusterfuck, it's probably about as sufficient as anything else he could have done to get her to start giving the friendship a chance. How do you sidle out of something like this? You don't. This miserable basket case needs all the help he can get. Karkat trying to talk to someone while his future self is in the same conversation is almost as if you were talking to a friend or a crush, and you had a little demon on your shoulder who was shouting all your private thoughts out loud and then mocking you for every embarrassing thought you had. The frightening thing is, Karkat might be accidentally proving this method to be a fairly effective pick-up maneuver? Like, rather than negging the intended target, you have an utterly ruthless wingman at your side constantly negging you instead. Eventually, like Jade is about to do here, she just fucking snaps. Then once the ice is finally broken, it's all smooth sailing from there. Trust me on this.\n\nWhen Jade says she's \"all ears,\" that's foreshadowing for when she has big dog ears later in the story. Ha ha, just joking, that isn't even remotely close to being true. Gotcha. Anyway, things really heat up quick here. Now that Karkat's unbelievably shitty strategy has broken the ice, they're letting loose all their bottled-up emotions. Who are they even kidding at this point? They might as well just be making out here. With the massively cross-pollinating collision between troll and human affairs resulting in stirrings of Vrisjohn, Daverezi, and Rosemary, you knew it was only a matter of time before someone latched on to Jade too. Jadekat is a highly respectable shipping endeavor. Clearly there's much to work with here. One could hardly be blamed for imagining it had a chance to make a deep run, perhaps even threaten endgame status. I mean, it didn't, but it totally could have, and there's nothing wrong with you sitting down in its cheering section. It also has some intriguing quadrangular dynamics with Daverezi, considering Davejade, Karezi, and Davekat are all powerhouse ships as well. Okay, I'm going to stop now, before someone puts me into the nerd catapult and launches me into the ocean."

Now they finally catch up about it, but so much has happened between now and then that the accumulated intrigue has kind of started to have a muting effect on the intensity surrounding the events of Descend. There's a lot more going on now, and them touching on the topic of Prospit's destruction, Jade's dream death, and a heroic bunny rescue all seem like pretty casual points of conversation that can freely mingle with other banter, like how multiple Karkats have been macking on Jade lately. This is a pattern that plays out a lot in HS, probably unavoidably due to its scale, the size of the cast, and how many plot threads are being handled at once. Sometimes series of brewing events all coalesce and galvanize through some intense, dramatic, single event, as in Descend, [S] Make her pay, or the mother of them all, [S] Cascade.\n\nBut then those plot points are taken off the burner and put aside on the counter to cool, often for quite some time. This lets the story drift back to the casual, silly stuff, which can be seen as HS kind of gravitationally reverting to its most fundamental nature: ridiculous kids BS'ing with each other about stupid shit. But it was also a necessary thing to do from a creative production standpoint: I couldn't always focus just on the intense stuff and keep relentlessly following through on it while it was piping hot, because that was not a sustainable proposition in terms of effort (a thing the kids at home never really understood, while feeling inclined to grouse about pacing issues). So this gradual \"cooling effect\" of hot plot points actually became deeply interwoven with the story construction and how that flowed. The hot material is always revisited though—rarely is anything totally dropped—but when it comes back into play it definitely has a different effect for having spent several hundred (or even thousand) pages sitting on the windowsill to cool. That cooled-off material becomes a different kind of ingredient than it once was while it was red-hot, as if the recipe called for it to be set aside to cool, to change its nature, its feel, and the way it tastes. And meanwhile many other exotic ingredients have been prepared. So when the cooled-off ingredient is reintroduced, now it just feels like all the other ingredients coming together to make something new, rather than still feeling like \"the most important thing going on,\" as it once did. So then this amalgamation of new ingredients together with old, previously amalgamated ingredients, forms a new recipe, waiting for its turn to get thrown into the oven so everything can approach another critical galvanization as before. Rinse and repeat, until HS finally and miraculously ends."

And now you yourself are blundering right into one such woman's web. No wonder you and he are related. Back to the prototyping issue. The more you review the banter surrounding this topic and all the factors piling up, the more it starts to feel like the Becsprite outcome was fairly predictable, or at least within guessable territory. The kids speculate about putting in something lame or ridiculous to make the monsters weaker, which, narratively speaking, smacks of a plan that isn't going to work. So if you use that as a clue to get on the story's wavelength, you'd be led to think, \"What could possibly go wrong here that would accomplish the opposite effect?\" And there aren't many good answers to that. Knights, mummies...none of this crap realistically is going to make Jack that much stronger than he already is. Bec is the only thing around here with that kind of power. Probably the only deterrent to guessing this will happen is that Bec has been established to be SO powerful that his prototyping would escalate the stakes so radically, it almost doesn't feel plausible. How do you beat Jack if he's omnipotent, can teleport anywhere, and is basically indestructible? But then, that's also what makes [S] Jade: Enter such an intense development. It also makes everything kind of fit: why the kids blew it and made their session unwinnable, as the trolls have been warning them since the start. It connects a few other dots too. Even so, I don't remember many people predicting the idea with much confidence. Some guessed it as a possibility, but nobody thought it was a slam dunk.

It would be nice if they could catch up, just like she and John did, and I bet they would like that, but this brings up a challenging aspect in managing this big ensemble. The dialogue is all very banter-driven, and there are a lot of characters, which means there's a mathematically very wide range of pairings to consider for such banter, even if you limit it to only the most relevant pairings. It was always an option for me to just...ignore the potential for banter, by not showing it. For example, the Rose/Jade chats never got much play, and I think that was largely due to these bandwidth issues. As a result, they're a lot more likely to talk to/about the boys than each other, which wasn't a thing that was \"designed\" about their relationship. It just resulted organically from the factors I'm describing here. (The Jade/Rose ship name is Bye-Bye Bechdel, FYI.) Aside from just ignoring certain conversational matchups, it actually helped the writing process a bit to have these little devices that blocked certain conversational possibilities, and so narrowed the potentially wide range. Usually that device is \"person is asleep, or otherwise indisposed.\" Like Jade is for much of the early acts, which actually does free the characterization bandwidth a bit while establishing some fundamental things about the other characters. Here, she's just finished catching up with John, plus weathering an icebreaker fracas with the Karkats. I think it would be goofy pacing to then have her really hash it out with Dave. That's something that can, and does, wait until later. So Dave being asleep turns out to be narratively convenient, and was partly designed to be so. The sleeper is awake, the waker is asleep...

They're the ones who pushed that phrase into the comic's lexicon, much like they did with Trickster Mode.) It just seemed like a funny thing to me for readers to \"worry\" about. I'm not sure whether it was actual concern for this fictional character's well-being, or more of a variation on the fandom staple, \"This character is going through some changes and drifting away from the profile I know and love, and I don't like it!\" Either way, it was sort of funny, and within that context their conversation here reads as a little response to that. Like John is the \"concerned\" guy, and Rose is telling him not to worry. She comes across as pretty reasonable about it, actually. So I guess the REAL punchline is, despite these highly rational reassurances, later she just bellyflops into the deep end of the goth pool and fully \"goes grimdark\" as an actual serious plot point. Which reads as much more of a takedown of this ridiculous fanon-imposed idea than this brief conversation does. If nothing else, it sure does COMMIT to lampooning the idea, via a totally serious and deadpan integration into the story. Which sure seems to happen a lot in this comic.\n\nFrankly, John is coming off as a bit of an asshole here. They've only been at this, what? A few hours? The better part of a day at most. And he's pointing to some of Rose's habits as evidence that she's fundamentally changing in temperament? \"You used to tell jokes and read books. But Rose, it's been HOURS since I heard you say a joke, or talk about a book you like!\" Dude, you've been sleeping a lot and getting harrassed by trolls all day. You barely know anything about what she's going through, and it's only been a few hours. Did you know that people can go a few hours acting a little differently than they usually do? It's called being in a \"mood.\" But it's understandable that John sounds a little dumb here, since he's partly serving as a mouthpiece for a dumb fandom-subset attitude, which is always a surefire way to give one of your characters a temporary lobotomy. On rereading this, John's end of this conversation really strikes me as \"Dumb Dude Tries Talking To A Girl Online\" sort of material. Maybe he's suddenly a little nervous because now it's in the back of his head that he's \"supposed to marry her\"? That's a possibility. Anyway, Rose then starts saying a bunch of funny stuff which basically amounts to roasting John for his irritating remarks which border on concern-trolling. And he deserves a good roast.

The fact that the Green Sun fits this description as well may suggest to us that these two cosmic bodies may have a date with one another. But we'll just have to see about that. John seems to deduce that removing the Tumor from the Battlefield will result in \"curing\" it of a cancerous ailment. And he's not wrong about that. Their session has a really big defect, and the Tumor is a very literal, explosive embodiment of this fact. Much later we see the Alpha trolls had a sort of mini-tumor in their session too, suggesting this is just something certain sessions have. Doomed sessions have a way of building these tumors in as a means of providing a sort of self-imposed cleanup service for Paradox Space. But this topic can probably wait for when we actually see the thing in action. John describes himself as the planet's \"doctor,\" which seemingly references the name of the song that accompanied the animation that first revealed LOWAS. The name of the song didn't have anything to do with this idea at the time (I didn't even name the song), but I did sort of retro-fit its name to suit the Story purpose. The theme of \"planet healing\" runs throughout all the lands. The need to clean up a planet covered in oil, a planet of polluted oceans, a planet of clockwork gummed up by sticky amber, a wintry planet affected by nuclear fallout. And now, finally, a planet in the middle of all of them that has a literal tumor which will destroy everything if not removed. The Tumor is a signifier that this null session is terminal, doomed from the start, thus rendering the other cleanup jobs posing as \"personal quests\" as moot. But ordinarily they show what Sburb has to offer: \"fix\" your planets to complete the cosmic quest, and \"fix\" yourself to complete your personal quest. But as I've been getting at a lot down here, things just ain't that simple. Personal growth via outward, institutionally regimented means is a path of false promise. And from this vantage, it begins to make sense on a thematic basis why the session was \"doomed from the start.\" The Tumor in the heart of the Battlefield is, in a way, the game acknowledging this dark truth about itself."

This is a nerdy thing I'm doing, rating my own shit by arbitrary metrics, isn't it. But there's no way you're not a huge nerd, otherwise you wouldn't even be reading this note. So let's be careful about what we throw in glass houses. Speaking of which, in a few pages Jade is about to get thrown through the wall of her own glass house.\n\nThe \"entry item challenge\" is established right away here. Each of these challenges escalates in obscurity with every new player who enters, becoming more esoteric and less clear with what exactly the player is supposed to do to solve it. First, Jade is shown the piñata, so she knows it's there. Then she's magically blindfolded. No way she's getting that thing off until she's in the game, or dead. So she can deduce what to do: smash the thing open, obviously. Except it's not that simple. She'll try that soon and it won't work. She's gotta shoot it, while blind. Which is hard! So now we know everything about all four entry-item challenges. There's plenty to say about all of them. Should I make this another long post? Yeah, why not, what do we have to lose at this point. Look, I'm even going to include a line break. You can't stop me. No one can. \n\nI talked about this way back, maybe even in an earlier book? Well, here I go again, so hold on to your ass. There are four entry items: Apple of knowledge, Bottle of wine, Crow's egg, Dog piñata. A, B, C, D. All of them are related to new life or new beginnings. You bite the apple, you fall from grace, enter a new world, begin this wild journey. You smash a bottle to christen a ship. An egg hatches, creating new life. You break a piöata to celebrate a birthday. Each involves breaking or puncturing something. Each involves a form of sustenance, or something to consume (piñatas have candy inside). Two are vessels for the substance (bottle, Piñata), two are the food items themselves (apple, egg), and one arguably counts as both (egg). Two of them drop from the same basic tree template (apple, piñata). They ramp up in complexity. John's is a simple test: bite the forbidden fruit. Not much to it. A single unit of departure, almost conceptually elemental, like an apple, as Rose goes on about later. The challenges get trickier. Rose has to break a bottle. Easy enough idea, but things go wrong, and she has to take a blind leap to get it done. A sacrificial gesture, and one of faith in a friend (Jaspers). Dave's is even more obscure. A simple test of patience, but one that's not clear. He isn't told what to do and just has to wait. Non-action is the key, and in a way it's another gesture of faith under dire circumstances. Finally, Jade's challenge incorporates a lot of these elements. It's another \"blind faith\" situation. She has to take a shot in the dark. There's a sacrificial gesture, but instead of risking herself (like Rose), Jade must symbolically sacrifice her friend via effigy and cannot complete the sacrifice without help from that friend. (Bec must redirect the bullet. There's no way this works if he doesn't.) It is also a signifier that the pet she knew as a friend her whole life is about to, in a way, become her enemy. Like a good dog gone bad, who now must be put down.\n\nThe mystery of how John falls asleep and shipwrecks his bed in the oil is quickly addressed here. First, note how before he grabs the blue lady doll, he actually maims it a bit. He rips its eye. That way, Jack will have two damaged eyes, and theoretically should be totally blind. Meaning they'd have to face a blind adversary with a fabulous blue mane of hair. But of course we know that doesn't happen. John falls asleep and drops the doll at the last minute. Why? Vriska. It's like that joke in The Simpsons—any time you're wondering why something happened, just assume a wizard did it. Except in Homestuck the wizard is Vriska. Why does she do this? She wants to be important so desperately, she's willing to insert herself into the narrative even if it's for bad reasons. She wants to be the one directly responsible for the creation of the \"ultimate end boss.\" Which is pretty dickish of her, I suppose. But when you think about it, there's something kind of pathetic about it. Because it's not really even her idea: the fact that she knows it happened is what gives her the idea. She knows Bec Noir is what made the session unwinnable, and by browsing Trollian, she could see the event that leads to his creation, which is John falling asleep at exactly the wrong moment. But when Vriska saw it happen on the screen, she had no way of knowing his nap was because of her. Until she decides to become responsible for it, thereby making it true in the first place. So she's not even the original author of her own diabolical self-insert intervention. This was established earlier as something she does, given her nature as a thief. She takes credit for other people's stuff, like Equius's robot that she was going to regift to Aradia. Vriska slaps her name on things and claims them for her own. In this case, she even slaps her name on the IDEA of slapping her name on the origin of Bec Noir. Neither thing really originated from her in a meaningful way.\n\nBec considers how to handle the crisis and defend his master's life. First, he gets all the trash out of the living room, which is both a nice decluttering measure (so all that crap is gone and I don't have to think about it anymore) and a signal closing of the possibility that anything from that pile is going to end up in the kernel. There is a good question here, which I don't think ever gets a totally clear answer, outside of a series of factors you can make some deductions from. Which is: why does Bec actually do this? Prototype himself, I mean. If the goal is to eliminate the meteor threat, he already has the power to do that easily, by teleporting it somewhere else. Is it mere doggy whim? An instinctive, ominous desire to increase his power? An inbuilt impulse to cooperate with predestined events critical to this session? Is he under some sort of influence? Is it TAVROS??? (Later Tavros is demonstrated to have the ability to control Bec. This is how he ends up getting Grandpa killed.) One argument against that possibility is that Tavros is fundamentally allergic to doing anything extreme or important. He's kind of the anti-Vriska. \"Taking credit\" for the rise of Becsprite in this manner is something Vriska would do (in fact, she just did). Alternatively, since she just showed the willingness to do this, you could also speculate that she controlled Tavros to control Bec to do this. But that's REALLY going down a rabbit hole of conspiracy.\n\nI could just tell you what my opinion is. You may do as you will with it, if you decide I am a credible source on this subject. I think it's more interesting to consider behaviors like this as instinctive features of a First Guardian. We always got kind of a creepy vibe from Bec. He's technically defending Jade, but there's something ominously ulterior about his presence. If there are any beings who would be uniquely encoded to instinctively commit whatever self-fulfilling deeds are critical to Sburb's agenda, it would be a First Guardian. We've seen how Doc Scratch has no compunction about doing the same, but he does so by bringing his powerful intellect to bear on the task, rather than the way a dog would handle it, through powerful instinct. There are many necessary features of blowing up the meteor like this. The Bec-head exile station must be seeded in many parts all over the planet. The destruction of Earth, a shame though it is, is still critical to everything. If he simply teleports the meteor away, there's no impact of this size to wipe everything else out. Yet he can't let it strike the house. So this seems to be the best compromise. Oh, also let's not forget that the existence of Bec Noir is critical to the ultimate dysfunction of this session. Maybe that's why Bec is a little creepy. He's only innocently following his instincts, but his instincts demand that he help bring about some very dark outcomes.\n\n> Becsprite: Engage snake mode. That's one long, magic dog. Yeah I dunno what's going on with that either. It looks cool? There are some extremely mild hints of the tadpole's journey up to Skaia. Jade also flails around down there with her rifle, still assuming you have to bash the piñata like normal. It's a little reminiscent of when she was running around her greenhouse with a bag of fertilizer, goofing off. I hope you're learning a valuable lesson here, which is that things are often reminiscent of other things. If they weren't, then every discreet concept you could think of would be perfectly unique, have no relation to any other concept, and we'd be adrift in a sea of totally inert, noncombinative principles, which frankly sounds like total madness. Heh, here I am on my high horse about certain topics again. It's usually at this point in the spiel that my grandkids mix a powerful sedative into my applesauce and put a padlock on the door to my nursing home.\n\nThis entry challenge is kind of brutal. When you do the obvious thing you're supposed to do with this piñata, it punishes you with a huge explosion that launches you out of your highrise greenhouse. You know, if you happen to have one of those. A few notes ago I talked about this challenge as a symbolic gesture of having to put down a good dog gone bad. Some notes of Old Yeller here, which is a tale about a kid who has to shoot his dangerous dog as sort of a symbolic coming-of-age gesture. Except since Bec is omnipotent and basically indestructible, he can't actually be put down. The sacrificial gesture can only be conveyed through effigy. There's been a lot of foreshadowing about this, like Dave referring to Bec as a devilbeast and saying he'd take him out behind the shed and shoot him (probably jokingly, but who knows really). Jade's strife with Bec is presented as kind of a playful iteration of this idea, where she's playing \"fetch\" with bullets, but in doing so, is effectively shooting him in the head and letting his crazy powers outmaneuver the bullet across time and space. The challenge here is sort of a final callback to these ideas, putting the concept of a symbolic sacrifice of a deadly animal in a more serious and high-stakes context. Bec is a good dog, a best friend, a vigilant guardian, but there are ominous signs he's very dangerous too, a beast who potentially is at risk of biting the hand that feeds him. This explosive trap set by the piñata, innocently inviting Jade to do the obvious thing but severely punishing her for it, is a little facet of this symbolic challenge: the lurking threat of a seemingly good dog lashing out. And the \"bite\" is commensurate with the dog's ridiculously overpowered status.\n\nSo... Bec can do this? Yeah, looks like he can do this. At least, now he can. Could he shoot huge lasers before he prototyped himself? It doesn't actually seem like that was in his power set during his prior strife sequences. He could teleport anywhere, resize stuff, move at warp speed, crackle with electricity and green fire. Sprites, however, have been previously established as laser-blasting entities—Nanna can do it, and we saw Calsprite do it. So this seems like a pretty decent answer as to why Bec wanted to prototype himself, at least in terms of immediate abilities gained. It was the only way to blast the meteor into a million pieces before it enters the atmosphere. Blowing it up is a very important need, according to his instincts.\n\nGetting the Bro/Davesprite/Jack fight into the mix here was important not just because it was Cool, but also because now that we just saw Bec prototype himself, this is kind of a bigtime Oh Shit moment for the consequences that's about to have on this battle. Bro and Davesprite are holding their own pretty well for now, but these rad dudes are about to have serious problem on their hands. Good thing Bro decided to draw Jack into fighting him at the precise location of his future tomb. Saves everyone a lot of trouble.\n\nJade's falling from her tower, doesn't have much time, and takes literally the only action available to her, which also happens to be the correct action. Which is to take a random blind shot with her rifle and hope the bullet somehow winds up hitting the piñata. Luckily for her, shooting in practically any direction would have gotten the job done, since now that Bec is a sprite, he understands how to cooperate with the game logic to assist his player. He redirects the bullet, just like we saw him do on his strife page. Somewhat morbidly, I guess, this also involves him assisting with the completion of his own ritual sacrifice via effigy, by taking a bullet through his own head first, warping space, and allowing the bullet to pass through his effigy's head. Truly a good dog, a best friend, and loyal to a fault. Kind of like if Old Yeller brought Travis the gun, loaded it, used his mouth to aim it for him, put his paw on the kid's finger to fire the gun, and then ran in front of the bullet. So tragic.\n\nAs has already been implied (by the glimpse at Kanaya's land, which included the volcano next to her hive), the Forge is swept into the session along with the Space player's house. That whole patch of land is treated as a sort of unit. Actually, this information was provided way back at the end of Act 2 (in [S] WV: Ascend) when we saw WV fly to the site of the frog ruins on post-apocalyptic Earth, and there was the huge depression in the ground where both Jade's house and the volcano would have been. Now we finally see that gash in the land being created. The session won't let the Space player enter without her huge, lava-propelled, tadpole-firing gun, will it? Unless the session is impotent (i.e. a void session), in which case it's more than happy to leave Jake's volcano behind. But then, he's not a Space player. He's a Hope boy. Those guys seem more about diminishing the likelihood of procreation than improving it. (Remember what Eridan did with the matriorb?) So it makes perfect sense that Jake is responsible for his session's impotence, and not just because he's a loser. But that doesn't exactly help, either.\n\nThis is a very similar sequence to jack's first dramatic transformation in [S] Jack: Ascend, with the same pose and all. Except instead of becoming more ridiculous, this time he becomes more terrifyingly badass. Oh, wait. No, he's...he's growing a dog snout. Okay, I take that back, he's getting ridiculous again. Still, I think it's safe to say this version of him is more intimidating than Clownjack, especially since we know of Bec's capabilities. When designing him, I had a few options. I could just keep piling more shit on him, make his design an even more garish, cluttered aggregation of prototyped elements, which I think was the expectation established by the mods we saw in the troll session. But instead I kind of simplified the design, collapsed the clown hat, hid the tentacles (he keeps them \"phased out\" and can bring them back when he wants), and streamlined his silhouette overall. This makes the design stronger, and perhaps just as importantly, much easier to draw. You can never rule that out as a factor in the way characters are designed.\n\nHave we talked about the specific relationship between Bro and Davesprite? This is probably the last chance, since Bro is about to die a Warrior's Death, and Davesprite is about to fly the coop and go unseen for a long time, making us think he might have died, like an inconsiderate bastard. We never see any interaction between Bro and Davesprite except for this stoic alliance they form to fight Jack, probably while exchanging a series of curt nods and glances now and then. This is the bonding moment they have, possibly of a reconciliatory nature on some level, where they are unified in combat, putting aside their differences to take on a powerful adversary. Contrast this with Dave's bonding moment with Dirk at the end, which is much more substantive, an emotional deep dive rather than this symbolic appearance of solidarity. Even though they're basically the same person, and are two facets of one bigger character profile, there are a lot of ways in which Dave and Davesprite diverge. Dave, as the supposedly \"real\" version we keep the spotlight on, has the luxury of pursuing the full scope of his longform emotional arc, or the \"broken sword\" path. He gets to be the more emotionally complex guy and sift through the traumas of his past with Dirk himself, a more humanized iteration of Bro. Whereas Davesprite, as a sort of self-aware runner-up splinter of Dave himself, is relegated to a shallower and lonelier hero's journey, or an \"unbroken sword\" path (note that his sprite form endows him with a whole sword permanently). So what choice does he have but to embrace the superficial qualities of the hero's journey, the kind which (in the context of Dave's arc) requires that you push your feelings down, suppress your traumas and all the things that make you what you are, man up and be a cool sword-wielding hero, just like they're doing here. This is all he gets, the stoic, voiceless facade of Dirk, the abusive guy who made his childhood miserable. But none of that matters now. All that matters is The Fight. Of course, Davesprite's arc extends quite a bit beyond this moment as well, but starting to understand his journey in these terms sheds more light on him as an individual rather than just viewing him as Other Dave. There's a lot more he has to cope with later, as a superfluous doppelganger of a more important person, who just seems to linger on without purpose, and has to live the more shallow version of Dave's arc. The ultimate endpoint of Davesprite's journey can be seen as a final release from these existential burdens, both for him specifically, but also for Dave himself as a more \"generalized concept\" of a person.\n\n/Slams hard on the brakes of the Davesprite meta, sending the vehicle screeching and swerving off the road./ Hey, look! A really important revelation, ensconced in an already manic, overloaded animation. This is a big deal. Not only are we finding out that Bec is the fourth prototyping, pushing Jack to ludicrous heights of invulnerability, we're also filling a glaring hole in the troll side of the story: the identity of the indestructible demon, and how he got there. We were mostly led to believe the demon was Lord English, via red herring language that coded Jack in all the same ways English was coded. There was also no reason to expect it was Jack, since \"indestructible demon\" didn't describe him accurately at the time. But now it clearly does. As for how he got there, well, he just appeared on the frog platform, freaked out all the trolls, and Aradia with some quick thinking got them all the hell out of there. That's a good enough explanation for now. Of course, we don't yet know how he zapped to that frog platform, where he came from, or what led to those events. We need to wait for [S] Cascade to finally plug that gap.\n\nSOMEONE needed to clean up all these doomed Aradiabots. Jack volunteers for the job. It would be confusing if there were this many of them sticking around forever. Of course, they all must have known this was their endpoint. And yet they all waited for him to show up anyway. They welcomed their demise, Since it was always unavoidable. I guess that's what doomed means? Whew, edgy stuff. Meanwhile, Karkat's dream self finally wakes up, just in time to see his stab buddy one more time, and then die.\n\nJack's Bloody Hand is a new mystery. That's what we do here—we answer some important questions while introducing a few more. \"What's the deal with the bloody hand\" is an obvious question that lingers for the rest of the act. In addition to just being another little rolling mystery, it also nicely doubles as a distinguishing mark between Jack in the human session and this future Jack who travels to the troll session. So now whenever we see bloody-handed Jack without much surrounding context, we automatically know it's the one in the troll session. As for where the blood came from, that's another answer that [S] Cascade provides, and is super, duper, super, super sad.\n\nHere's a nice transition trick. Jack mask-zooms into a starfield out in space, and the starfield gradually transitions into gently falling snow, as the background shifts to the mysterious wintry fog of whatever Jade's land is. It a teasing reminder to us that, oh yeah, despite all this dramatic shit, Jade actually did enter her land, which is a major milestone of progress and something to look forward to. Her successful entry challenge wraps up with a little callback. She's falling from her tower yet again, just like she did in [S] Descend when her robot blew up her bedroom and she fell while sleeping. Now she's falling again, but wide-awake this time, and she seems pretty pleased about it?"

Oh, you don't care about spoilers, and obviously haven't cared for many hundreds of book pages already? Great. The Queen's plan here is really simple: she knows about the horrible threat Bec Noir poses. She's had access to Skaian clouds for a long time, and thus knows many things while still not knowing others. (Such as whether or not this plan actually works. All she seems to know is it's worth a shot.) Her goal is to destroy all of the exile stations, which serve as portals back into the human session. This will lock Jack in the session (at least, by destroying most entry points...but she seems to forget about one very important one in the frog ruins). She's containing the damage by burning the bridges. This key switches the final Bec-head station from \"broken and scattered everywhere\" to \"solid,\" reassembling it right here. She does this so she can destroy it. Why reassemble it just to blow it up? Why not just leave it like that? Because bombing it is the only way it stays disassembled for good, in case some crafty son of a bitch like DD might have gotten a duplicate key or could hack this keyhole. Point is, it's better to be thorough, and this way we get to see the fourth station, which is pretty cool. Like all exile stations, it's modeled after the entry item of the player whose house formerly occupied the station's landing site. In this case, there was no single landing site, since Becsprite blew the huge meteor carrying it to a million bits. But the most important piece landed here: the piece with the keyhole that activates its homing beacon for reassembly purposes."

As a large vessel, it \"knows\" it's going to be scattered into pieces and so has two modes: broken and whole. And a user can toggle between the two modes using a key, as the queen just did. This is true of the egg station as well, which also has two modes: halved and whole. The queen used the same key to switch the egg station to whole and journey here with it. Note that the egg found in two halves also had to do with the fate of its carrying meteor, which was split in half by Bro. Also note that the fate of the station corresponds with what happens to the entry item. Dave's egg hatched, splitting in two pieces. The Bec piñata was also shot, busting it into many small pieces, just like Bec did with the meteor. So maybe we can extrapolate here about WV's cork station. It was fired from a much larger bottle station, buried deep in the sand, but we never saw the full bottle. We know that Rose's entry item was also a bottle, which she had to grab by the neck and smash against something. So does this mean the buried bottle station was actually broken, under the sand?

The statue was \"conveniently\" beheaded much earlier to make way for the reappearance of this station, timed exactly with the rise of Bec Noir. The frog head reads as an old god or figure of worship being overthrown and replaced by a new, wrathful god, a grim false idol asserting dominance over the former kingdom of the genesis frog. In other words, this is Bec Noir's universe now. He hasn't arrived yet, but it's only a matter of time, and the realm is now his to do whatever he wants with. As a Dersite, what he wants unfortunately is to kill any frog he sees, especially one as important as this. And killing the frog means destroying the entire universe contained within it, which he has seemingly just achieved enough power to accomplish. The threat Bec Noir poses to the universe is not totally clear, since the story hasn't really connected those dots for us yet. But you can see how there was a long breadcrumb trail setting all this up, mostly through symbolism of frog desecration. The total destruction of universes has been a dire possibility looming in the background noise of the story since the beginning."

Conveniently, John is cued up at the exact point in the story that we are caught up to. There are no Trollian-style hijinks with these station monitors. They progress linearly, almost like a live stream of the session piping directly into the station. Which means the passage of time we witness for the exiles maps directly onto the passage of time for our heroes in the session. Hence, from the POV of a station monitor, we have a fairly concrete approximation of \"now\" from a storytelling perspective, which is a useful device when it comes to a story that hops madly all over its own timeline. I INSIST THAT THIS IS INTERESTING. So I'll keep on it for a bit. Time is an extremely fungible resource inside the Homestuck narrative. We go backwards, forwards, hop to different timelines and entirely different fields like the troll session, where that timeline is untethered from the human universe and session. So basically, it's a mess. But there is another kind of meta-timeline existing outside the story: the timeline for the reader, which ties to the pace of story progression and what \"present moment\" is being focused on through the viewport of the website. The present moment can include any juxtaposition of several events that are taking place at different points in time, or different universes and sessions. Thus two things that don't happen at the same time inside the story (like what we're watching here) do appear to happen at the same time outside of the story. This is the nature of \"circumstantial simultaneity,\" which Doc Scratch gets into a bit later. Remember how the exile station monitor was originally introduced as sort of a meta-viewport for the story from within the story. Story commands could still be entered, directing the character to do things, except those commands were now being entered by...another character in the story. So that means these station viewports, any time we see them, are pretty reliable windows into whatever we might call \"the present moment\" from the perspective outside the story. In this case, it's very close to \"now\" for us. Just a little before [S] Jade: Enter."

The only thing WV's going off of is his distant memory from the Battlefield that John is, in fact, capable of doing some sort of windy thing.\n\nThis is probably the first real indication that John is capable of doing cool and formidable shit, instead of just being a useless dork with silly hammers who likes movies and flounders around.

We heard Vriska a few pages ago invoke his catch phrase, but in reference to Jack rather than English: \"He is already here.\" It's true. The threat, whether it's Jack or LE, already exists, regardless of whether you try to bring him about or instead preempt his existence. Any \"supreme villain\" in this story will be intrinsically stitched into the fabric of cyclical reality. You can't stop them from coming into being, and you can't make them dead until they're good and ready to go, as authorized by Paradox Space. As such, the emphasis in the story never really is \"How to stop the villains,\" even though the heroes presume it must be due to consuming all the same media we do. The emphasis is on Other Things, existing in a state of tension with traditional adversities in the backdrop. And if you have become a scholar of these book notes—which, sadly, you obviously have—then you must know all about what those Other Things are by now."

Maybe she's repurposing her old jab at Tavros to be more legitimately congratulatory toward her brand-new boyfriend, known as Better Tavros? Whatever, who cares what this crazy person meant. In another story, you could imagine John's big, windy display as foreshadowing for when he finally, triumphantly uses this ability to defeat a terrible endboss, like Jack or LEE. Like maybe John makes a huge WIND FIST and crushes LE to death, and we're like, WOW, and throw a big party and cry a lot. Too bad I just debunked that. John still get to use this rad new power in a lot of important ways, but they tend to be more procedural and plot-advancing rather than tactical. For example, he summons a huge Wind Drill to carve the Tumor out of the Battlefield (and the hole nicely doubles as an entry point for the tadpole much later). And finally, the supreme validation of John as the best Windy Boy is when he uses his power in a way that's visually reminiscent of first time he uses it, on the previous page. That's at the final completion of his quest, after blowing all the clouds away, fully realizing his retcon powers, freeing himself from the confines of the story and transporting LOWAS to the blankspace, thus releasing the fireflies just as the salamanders foretold. An offbeat metaspin on the type of personal quest we might have originally imagined when first exploring LOWAS. So the point I'm getting at here is, when we see John's potential here with all this cool wind blowing around, it really is the beginning of a lengthy arc related to the development of this ability, and the final implementation of it to do something narratively critical. It's just that the full ascendancy of this potential doesn't play out in combat. It's about freeing himself, and everyone else, from the cyclical, fatalistic prison of the story, wherein they find themselves surrounded by unbeatable foes who all tend to be \"already here.\""

What's with all these misattributed quotes? Did I explain this? We've just covered a big stretch of story which, thanks to Vriska, has been heavy with notes about crassly misappropriating certain kinds of content—words, deeds, entire story events—and slapping someone else's name on those things to retroactively reassign credit and reshape the way the content is perceived. Almost a cyclical contamination of the content, an attempt to confuse and misdirect by repurposing what is already known. Combine this element with the misquotes that go back to Act 1, as well as some other things like the tendency to rename pets, and it seems to me we have the basic constituents of what you might call a \"theme.\" What is the nature of the theme? What does it mean? Do I need to tell you everything?? Maybe it's time for you to put that noggin of yours to work and come up with some of your own answers. I already know what it means. My boy Dutton over there knows what it means, Look at him. He's tickled as fuck that you can't figure it out. Laughing his ass off at your ignorance. Good, I'm glad you feel ashamed, it's character-building. What I will say is, the latter part of the quote, about solid flesh and dew, that's Shakespeare. The rest of it I just made up. You can kind of tell, right? None of the other poetic excerpts had original material woven into the misquoted text, but Jade always was the pattern breaker of the group. Customizing the false quote with specifics relevant to this moment—the forge, winter skin, bedsheets (Jade's on a bed in this Flash), irons in the fire—makes it better suited to her land intro. It's also sort of retro-fitted to the Shakespeare line, expanding on the idea that a blanket of snow is like a layer of flesh, which can melt upon the introduction of a heat source. Like the first human to appear in a frozen wasteland, or the dormant volcano she brought with her, which she has the ability to stoke. There's...a lot going on here??? The point is, then I slapped Dutton's name on it for some insane reason, and called it a day.\n\nAnother land intro, more scenery porn and haunting music. I don't usually subscribe to the idea that these books absolutely murder the souls of the animations by making them static, but these environmental pieces really do feel vacant without the music. There was some magic in getting to know these places for the first time in the Flash format, and I think this was one that really sold that feeling in particular. The \"Frogs\" in the LOFAF title remained garbled right up until this moment, to keep you guessing. Finally the time is right to show it. Is it a stunning reveal? Not really. But censoring it until now lets us know it's a significant bit of information, and the moment it's revealed kind of signals something about the mystery word. That signal is something like, \"Hey, it's time for us to start getting serious about frogs and meditate upon their deeply significant cosmological role in the story.\" The Space player is all about creating space, i.e. the universe itself, which is one big frog, so she's all about frogs, breeding them and then deploying one special frog into Skaia via the Forge. We've finally crossed that threshold, and so has Jade. It's frogtime.\n\nThe \"pollutant\" of Jade's land is thick snow cover, brought about by something in the general department of nuclear fallout. Her bedsheet pattern has stylistically flipped to green, with the recurring sun icon conspicuously assuming this hue, in direct reference to—brace yourselves—The Green Sun. I know, the symbology is getting pretty hard to interpret, but hang in there. Much like Bec's head on top of the frog ruins reminds us of Bec Noir's sudden domination over these realms, flipping the familiar sun sigil to green also Signals that the Green Sun and its infinite energy supply are fully presiding over events now as well. It has the whole session, and this planet in particular, on lock. The green Bec-powers have always been associated with a sort of radioactive energy, so that would seem to be the impetus for this wintry nuclear fallout that's enveloped this planet, which is otherwise covered with banyan trees and frozen lakes full of frogs in icy stasis. LOFAF is the planet that goes through the most dramatic change when its ecological problems are solved. It quickly transforms into a tropical, swampy planet rife with all kinds of amphibious life ready to be harvested for cosmic breeding duties. It also seems to be the most trivial cleanup challenge, since all you have to do to get rid of the snow is light the Forge, making the planet warm enough so the snow melts. Jade does not appear to have much trouble doing exactly that later in this act. But it probably doesn't hurt that she gets some help from another Space player who already did it."

          "content": "And then, right away, we go backwards in time. Why get right down to business with Jade's land exploration when we can mess around some more and flash back to Feferi's first interaction with Jade? Nice point you made there, and I promise I feel very owned by it. But cool your jets, wise guy. We're doing a transitional trick here, and we'll get to Jade's land in a couple of pages, all right?? This seems like a flashback, but really it's the first good example of a dream bubble in action. The heart of Act 6, a.k.a. the Badlands of Homestuck, are rife with these things as a primary setting for story action. This scene introduces us to how dream bubbles work, without actually letting us know it's taking place inside of one (although we can start to infer this as the chat goes on). The full demonstration of dream bubble mechanics comes later, so for now this just reads as a run-of-the-mill, \"jump scare\" dream sequence we see all the time in media. A dream bubble sequence always starts with an innocent-looking flashback, which the story has made clear by now it will deploy at any time, for any reason. So from now on, you really have to be on your toes. When a flashback starts, you have to wonder whether it's a \"real\" flashback or the beginning of a dream bubble sequence. Dream bubbles always first assume the appearance of someone's memory, whether they're dreaming or dead. All environments inside of bubbles are made of nothing but memories. The environment starts to become malleable, sort of like a memory-collage, either once the dreamer gains awareness they've already done all this before, thus realizing they're asleep or dead, or once other dreamers or ghosts show up to start mixing their memories into the bubble as well. This makes for some pretty interesting settings later on, at least visually speaking.\n\nFeferi was directly responsible for getting the gods to blow all the dream bubbles specifically meant to contain all dead and sleeping characters in this story, in case that hadn't been made clear already in earlier Feferi moments. So there, she IS important, because she provided me with an infinitely useful gutter for all the dead characters to gather in, so they didn't really have to be totally out of the story. We get to check in with ghosts all the time. I mean, sure, they aren't important anymore, but they're still hanging around. That's essentially what death becomes in Homestuck: a sentence to irrelevance. Which is why it's such an especially crushing blow to Vriska, and why she found it so intolerable that she forced almost the entire span of Act 6 to twist itself into a huge narrative pretzel until it figured out how to get her back into action. Meanwhile, up there, these dream conversations get a little uncanny and confusing as the dreamer starts remembering that this already happened. The chat starts unraveling. This type of interaction is pretty standard from now on, and it often involves one of the characters (usually the dead one) kind of play-acting along with the reprised conversation until the other one starts remembering. It can serve as either a gateway to a lucid dreaming state that lets you connect with others at a great distance, or a fairly spooky, melancholy way of coming to the realization you're actually dead."

But that was a special situation. Kind of like a dream bubble ghost trapped in the physical plane by special forces. Did I speculate that it had to do with Aradia's ancestor helping her out? I may have. The Handmaid covertly propping up Aradia's exploits on Alternia makes some sense, which could even include using psychic abilities to keep Aradia's ghost stable after her death. Wait, we're going down an Aradia rabbit hole now, when we should be going down the Feferi rabbit hole. She's even got the rabbit ready and everything. Damn, even when she's on-screen and doing some interesting shit, she still can't catch a break. This is a pretty disturbing panel, actually, and not just because it's a cheap, jump-scare twist to end a dream. It ominously implies that Feferi is going to die, and we don't know how yet. For all the character death that Homestuck is known for, there really hasn't been much of it yet, so this feels significant. Dream selves die in droves, sure, and there are few other deaths involving resurrections or doomed selves. But none of that prepares readers for what Murderstuck feels like, with characters getting offed with seemingly no chance of coming back. So this is a creepy note to end the dream on, and it appears to be prepping us for some dark times to come."

You may recall there was a phoned-in one in Hivebent, with Karkat flailing his sickle at his crabdad in a single GIF. You have to go way back into Act 4 to find another legitimate one. They sort of fell out of favor as a format, since it was mostly a waste of creative man-hours for very little story-advancing return. The strifes always were just flavor pieces to help prop up the feeling that the story is also a game you can semi-play. But as the narrative intensity and complexity kick into higher gear, the story leans toward other devices to achieve this effect, while still pushing things forward, like the RPG mini-games. But Homestuck has a way of always coming back to earlier formats and ideas as if to say, \"Don't forget, this is still a thing we can do.\" This strife also does double-duty as a reminder that, due to the Bec debacle, not only do the players now have to deal with Bec Noir skulking around the session, but all the lesser enemies got an insane power boost too. Just this one shot of a uranium imp in Bec Mode allows us to extrapolate the effect across a full session of enemies, and so realize how untenable it probably is now for the players to accomplish even basic things.\n\nOther than that, there's not much to say about this strife. It's kind of a gag, a reprisal of Jade's original fight with Bec, but we're also getting a little teleportation tour of all known locations throughout the session, plus some we haven't seen before.\n\nBut just because this strife page is basically useless, it doesn't mean we can't do a few small useful things along the way. Jade swings by Dave's golden ruins and fires a shot that wakes him up. So, cool, he's awake, which means that soon Dave and Jade finally will be able to talk and catch up on stuff. In fact, he's got a great reason to get in touch with her, since he just saw her randomly appear in his land with an imp, fire a gun, and disappear again.\n\nHere's another useful datapoint in a panorama of nonsense: a glimpse of a huge statue of Jade's denizen, Echidna. If you were following along back in the day and were ass-deep in Homestuck lore, the moment you saw that statue, you'd have known it was Echidna. Why? Because it was previously established that the kids' browsers all had the same names as their denizens. We've already seen the little two-tailed snake icon on Jade's desktop. And here's a huge snake beast with two tails. We also know that the wands the bunny was wielding are the Quills of Echidna. And those needley things on the denizen's back sure look like quills. There's also a Future Dave strolling around, ridiculously underdressed for the weather. What's he doing out there? Do we ever find out? I don't remember at the moment. I think his presence here is mostly about letting us know Future Dave really gets around. He's got a lot more time to spare than everyone else."

Volcanic ash? In fact, we hadn't even met Bec, so it was hard to discern what was going on with this green energy. When Jade strifed with Bec about a hundred pages later, at that point we could deduce this explosion had something to do with him. The main missing piece of info at that point was Bec's prototyping, and the fact that as a sprite, he sensed PM's console interaction and reacted by \"protecting\" Jade from this obtrusive mail lady. The timeless rivalry between dogs and mail carriers is one of the understated gags going on here. Hold the phone, there's more hot trivia. Remember in an earlier note I was talking about how damage to the player's entry item seems to manifest as damage to the corresponding station? Bec blew up the huge meteor, scattering its pieces all over the world, and the pifiata similarly was busted into a lot of pieces, so the Bec-head station came in a bunch of broken pieces too. The egg cracked in half, and Bro split the egg meteor in half, so the egg station came in two halves.

I rernember that when this was all happening, there was some wild overestimation of the relevance of the exile subplot. Some readers seemed to think that the exiles were this crucial cast of side characters who were brutally discarded when [S] Cascade came around, therefore wasting the narrative engagement with them in the first place. That's really not what was going on. All this action happening in the margins of the story is largely dedicated to priming PM for her heroic ascension, to stalemate the Noir threat for a good while so that other arcs could be developed, and then to finally take him down. It's probably hard to discern while the story is still building up to that, but all the exiles are really just playing supporting roles around her: WQ is the wise mentor figure who elevates her by royal mandate, and WV and AR are the goofy, comic-relief sidekicks and/or romantic interests (?). They all get cut down, which not only serves to collapse this plotline and help simplify an ever-broadening story, but also functions as an utterly standard narrative device wherein the hero is righteously motivated to action through the deaths of those close to her. -->"

The story in a generalized way is always broadcasting the formal rules of Sburb and how it's \"supposed\" to go, whereas the narrative itself is often deviating from these rules in surprising ways. If Homestuck were a real game, it would make sense for its rule structure to be strictly followed in order to promote stability and playability. But since it's a story about a game, the deviations are what make it more interesting, in a way that it couldn't be if it were just a paint-by-numbers type of illustrated portrayal of a game idea. The deviations from a formal Sburb playthrough become the striking beats of narrative and arise from exhibitions of character choices and agency. They are the fuel for the surprises, the volatility and unpredictability of how things play out in practice rather than in theory. In a really simplistic way, you can look at most narratives as a cyclical procession of this basic idea: Expectations --> Deviations --> Expectations --> Deviations... It just happens that in Homestuck, the material for this repeating cycle is mostly the rules and structure of a game, and then later, expanding that cycle to include the rules and structure of Homestuck's narrative itself. But the fact that a story about a game almost needs to involve deviations from its own self-imposed rules in order to generate interesting material from a narrative standpoint tells you a lot about why Homestuck is the way it is. The \"broken session\" they're always struggling against is stitched into its story DNA as something that you could see as inevitable from the beginning. Structural dysfunction was always hiding in the marble, waiting to be chiseled out, because otherwise you're left with a more static narrative environment that provides less opportunities for satisfying these little expectation/deviation cycles. -->"

The latter allows the story to take shape in vibrant, unpredictable ways. And since it organically takes the shape of a story about a broken, dysfunctional, hostile environment for these kids to explore, practically every theme and conceit follows from these circumstances as well. They embrace a pattern of hacking, shortcuts, destroying guardrails, and rebelling from the imposed rigidity of a game rigged against them. These rebellious tactics keep picking up steam, especially as the roster expands and other characters like Vriska influence events and push those tactics even further. The players' personal quests seem laced with the idea of cracking a system or deviating from formula: breaking a sword to remove it from a stone, or making oil vanish by superseding narrative boundaries. This connects to the basic question of whether to embrace the regimentation of a heroic path conveniently laid out for you (the expectation), or to reject it as the shallow and rigid confinement of personal destiny (the deviation). These issues are expressed through the fundamental language of platonic idealism: perfect ideas of things, and then specific, imperfect instances of those ideas, or varied permutations, evolutions, or hacks of those ideas through alchemy. The way Sburb \"should\" go is an ideal (expectation), but the disastrous, chaotic way it actually goes is an imperfect instance (deviation). An \"idea\" of a person, such as Rose, along with her regimented heroic quest for growth, and all the great things she might imagine herself to become if she followed it, is an ideal (expectation). The messy, flawed, yet more genuinely human individual she does become resulting from her errant choices and rejection of formalism, is an imperfect instance of an ideal (deviation). What's the bottom line here? This is a lot. I know it's a lot. Homestuck is, in fact, a lot. I feel like I should better synthesize this somehow before I blow this popsicle stand. Check it out, here comes another rare line break down here in the laugh basement: \n\nHomestuck, as an examination of all forms of creative practice, whether cosmic or artistic, isolates the tension between perfect, celebrated idealization and specific, flawed instantiation. The purity of the ideal is what's initially sought, but the imperfection of the specific is what has true value. Conflict and suffering arise from the guilt and stress associated with overvaluing the former. Deliverance and humanity come from recognizing and embracing the latter."

This was a phrase used by fandom at the time which I appropriated into canon, to describe something going on that I've already been talking about here. But I haven't been using the phrase \"patron troll\" until now. I've been touching on it through the parlance of shipping, because that's probably the best way of dropping the pretense that these patron trolls latching on to humans has to do with anything other than awkward romantic posturing. A patron troll is one who shows overbearing, poorly disguised romantic interest in their human target, and expresses this through the form of intensively meddling with said human any chance they get. Hence why earlier I described this detailed recurring portrait format as a visual cue associated with this behavior. You don't get a portrait like this unless you are currently getting HELLA up in someone's grill about some heavy and personal shit. Therefore, we may conclude that any time we see a portrait like this, it is formal confirmation that this is the patron troll of whoever they're talking to. Jade's patron troll appears to have some ambiguity though, Since both Karkat and Tavros are depicted with such a portrait, and both trolls end up attempting to fit the description.

That's part of how character development works: firmly establishing someone's voice, patterns, and habits, then watching how they deviate from those under specific circumstances. Homestuck goes a little nuts with that idea through splinters, doomed selves, fusions, etc. This isn't even a splinter though, it's as basic as can be. A facet of Rose's personality that emerges when talking to a particular person. Maybe that's just another kind of splinter, in a way? The idea of splinters was always meant to capture the idea that a person is a great composite of inner multitudes, regardless of whether the faceting is metaphysical or mundane.

One more thing about the flintlock: all the Alpha Kid personal items they travel to Earth with seem to be related to death, either something that dies on the way down or is later used to kill with. The pony and kitten both die. The joke book kills Nanna, then later kills a cat. The flintlocks kill Sassacre, then Grandpa.

I think some readers thought this reveal reframed an interesting character trait of someone they liked (Jade) and made it feel less special, more artificially imposed on her, therefore making her a less interesting character in hindsight. But that's exactly what Vriska does: she steals certain intangible qualities from others. She steals luck, valor, agency, credit, and above all, relevance.

So maybe we instinctively start siding with Tavros, because generally we're supposed to Side with those on the receiving end of villainous diatribes. There are just a couple problems with this. First of all, he's Tavros, so we shouldn't be siding with him on anything. Second of all, many of the points Vriska's making are actually right? Tavros objects and calls her plans crazy, but she's correct in pointing out how he was trying to do exactly the same thing, just less effectively. And not to mention for selfish reasons—he was trying to control Bec to pump up his own self-esteem and use that swagger to horrendously flirt with a girl he barely knew. So he has no real credibility to object to Vriska's intervention. She calls him out on that, and she's totally right. Even though she's sort of insane, Vriska has a way of being right much of the time and often has a fairly practical analysis of certain situations, usually tactical ones. It can be frustrating when a villainous individual is right about a lot of things, because it can lead to some internal dissonance over whether or not you should be considering them villainous at all. In the case of Vriska, the dissonance is so strong that you really have no choice but to completely reverse your perception of her as a villain and fully embrace her as the true hero of the story.

Add in the shades and I'm cosplaying Dave, which was also en vogue and will probably go down in history as the laziest cosplay tradition ever. Oh, I'm also being controlled by Vriska apparently. And why not? We just learned that Vriska is retroactively behind almost everything, so for all intents and purposes, she might as well just be controlling me as I write the story as well. Isn't that basically an apt description of what's going on when an author starts obsessing over his favorite OC and starts shoving her in the spotlight repeatedly, uses her as his go-to tool for stirring the pot, inflating the drama, and rewarding her endlessly for pretty much just existing? What's the real difference between becoming obsessed with a favored OC and the possibility that she's literally hijacked the author's mind as a sort of powerful, conjured muse? Maybe you find it surprising I admit to all this so freely. Perhaps others would be embarrassed, or pause before acknowledging such subservience to a figment of authorial whim. But not me. There is no limit to the ways in which I will degrade and humiliate myself, all in the name of my beautiful waifu."

There's always been something a little childish about the echeladder aesthetic, like it's a leveling system meant for a little kid. Part of it is the toy-like design, but it's also conveyed through some of the names, like Riptike, Kneehigh Pilgrim, or Cool Buckaroo. The time for juvenile nonsense is over. Soon John must put aside his childhood ways and embrace his destiny as a very serious adult.

          "content": ">00:00 We're already doing another one of these playable RPG pages. [S] Past Karkat: Wake up. was posted on 10/25, and this page was posted on 12/15, not even two months later. That's how bonkers the pace was, back in this frenzied era of ceaseless content. The minigame turned out to be a compelling format, everyone was ecstatic about it, so the general feeling in the air was: why not do more of these? Might as well keep riding the wave. The game fosters these feelings of exploration and freedom, and brings a sense of enormity to the world and story just by adding a fun little sprite-based salamander village you could discover. An impression that you're directly helping John work his way toward finding his Quest Bed instead of just passively clicking through the pages until it happens. As you've seen already, these RPG games get kind of long when translated to book pages. So this game lasts for the rest of this book. Meaning that, in a way, this is the final page of the book. It's over already, I know. Isn't it crazy how the pages fly by when you're captivated by my tendency to preposterously over-explain my great story to you? But don't worry, I'll stay down here to keep you company during this home stretch, cracking wise, keeping it loose. Except for the pages where I decide to delete the gutter, because I don't particularly feel like devising commentary about a fucking mushroom John finds in a chest or something.\n\n>00:10 The game gets off to a strong start, because it gives you exactly what you were craving after reading a ton of Vriska's megalomaniacal bullshit: more Vriska. Her talksprite is being reused from the previous game because, why not. It was there, it was fine, and the dev cycle was literally several days long. We did need a new John talksprite, though. I think these sprites tended to get better and more consistent-looking as more of these games got made. John seems really on-point here. The outfit he got when Vriska was treating him like a dress-up doll is still pretty silly, I guess. He won't have to wear it for much longer, though. And no, that's not me lewdly insinuating he's about to seduce one of these salamanders. Good grief. Is that REALLY the first place your mind has to go??? Disgraceful.\n\n>00:33 Vriska gets down to business by saying what I already said, which is that gaining all the levels on your echeladder is kid's stuff. There are much bigger and cooler fish to fry, involving blue pajamas, pseudo-immortality, and a sword through the chest. She's the one to guide John through this process, not only because she's his patron troll, or because she wants to be responsible, but because she's the only one who's already done it herself.\n\n>00:41 This exchange probably creates some nomenclature ambiguity. Vriska says \"ascent through the god tiers,\" plural. Yet later on in the story god tier is referred to as more of a binary status, a cool mode you can achieve, and you stay that way forever once you do. The latter is a more apt way of describing it, but both ways are technically correct. There are multiple \"tiers\" to progress through after the initial transformation takes place. But they don't actually matter that much—just like the echeladder rungs, but with more serious-sounding tier names like \"REVENGE OF DOCTOR RAGNAROK\" and \"SAYONARA KANSAS.\" New grown-up branding, same useless results.\n\n>01:22 Even though it's in a different format, all this still feels pretty similar to the earlier walkaround Flash where John explores LOWAS and talks to salamanders. They say the same brainless NPC sort of things to continue filling out your understanding of the lore. They also bafflingly continue not to recognize John as the figure of legend they've heard about in their myths. There's nothing that significant about this fact. It's just always been my impression that in a lot of RPGs the NPCs tend to be kind of dumb, and tell tall tales about heroes right to your face, without realizing you were involved with the heroic exploits they're babbling about. It almost seems like a subset of dramatic irony that is specific to RPGs.\n\n>02:15 Also we're learning new points of lore from the villagers, because of course a lot more stuff has happened since we last explored a LOWAS environment. They've even had some time to come up with new mythical names for recent events, because giving lofty names to any big thing that happens in the game is probably in their DNA as NPCs. The Green Tragedy is a pretty good euphemism for having your village burned down by a lot of green fire. This really wasn't even that long ago, either. Easily less than an hour? The same temporal principle still seems to be in play in the Medium, where once something happens, it's as if it's been that way for a long time already. But then again, this may have little to do with temporal mechanics and more with the simple type of brains the consorts have, which make them born NPCs.\n\n>02:23 My sense is that NPCs say a lot of dumb things due to the basic reason that when games are designed, the people who make the maps and position the sprites are just trying to fill the environments out a lot of the time. Then the writers have to give those sprites some dialogue, and there's not always amazing things for random guys loitering around to say, so the writers just end up making them say dumb stuff that comes across as kind of funny. That's part of the charm of RPG-style environments like this. Not everything is a big deal. You just wander around at your own pace. A few people say intriguing things, but most just spout nonsense to provide environmental color.\n\n>02:53 The Heir has been gravely disrespected. John should shove this ignorant bastard down a parcel pyxis.\n\n>04:00 I feel obligated to point out any instance of the running gag where I imply Tab has sugar. I don't know if I've ever mentioned it before, but... Tab is bad? It sucks. Faygo is all right. Not good, not awful. But Tab is just plain bad. I always want to like it. I try to, because I like the can design. I've probably purchased Tab no less than half a dozen times just because I like the can. And yet, each time I am left with regrets.\n\n>04:08 Mushrooms don't grow in fucking orchards.\n\n>04:33 There is a minor joke here about how the salamaders are supposed to be guarding the orchard and not letting anyone through. Yet they're all scattered about, blowing bubbles, sort of lost in their own worlds, easily providing the space for John to wander through. These guys just don't have their shit together at all. No wonder their village burned down.\n\n>04:41 I have another confession to make: this battle serves no purpose. Few of them do, really. It's just that the game logic was already there, so it was easily adaptable for this game, with a couple of updated sprites. It is a more challenging battle, though, and you get to try out your cool, new time-freezing hammer while you're at it (not shown in video). Which, to be fair, isn't just a fun thing for you to try out. It actually does help defeat this much tougher imp in a tactical sense.\n\n>07:18 The return of the Mushroom Farmer is a very emotional moment. We missed him so much, along with his dedication to farming all these goddamn mushrooms. Notice how we've switched game logics here, which is a nice twist to this RPG Flash. We're switching back to standard sprite mode, which allows you to battle a Bec imp and try your hand at a much more powerful adversary than the ones you fought in the first LOWAS game.\n\n(Not shown in video) You almost get the sense that the Mushroom Farmer considers his agricultural duties burdensome? Quite a salty attitude he's showing here about harvesting delicious mushrooms. I like to think this is less a reflection on his enjoyment of his work and more an indication of the no-nonsense, rough-and-tumble persona of a seasoned farmhand. He's just gonna give it to you straight, see? This guy won't blow bubbles up your ass.\n\n>07:34 John blew away the clouds briefly there, but they came back. They're stubborn, because they're magic clouds integral to his quest. He needs to play a big pipe organ to get rid of them. The organ is clogged with oil, and he needs to realize his incredible retcon powers to get rid of all the oil. Meaning, when John clears the clouds and releases the fireflies, they're inevitably going to scatter into the blank, in-between space of the MSPA metarealm, not the Medium, as one might imagine. The lore of the quest says they're being released into heaven. So I guess the metarealm is heaven, at least according to the salamanders. So John's planetary challenge apparently revolves totally around the eventuality that he masters these preposterous retcon powers, it would seem. What jackass designed this quest?! Anyway, this salamander is doomed to be incredibly sad some day, because those fireflies are going bye-bye. Assuming he even lives that long. It will be another three years of local time on this planet before John pulls that off.\n\n>07:50 John, you son of a bitch. You could easily afford to buy this hungry salamander 100 grasshoppers. And yet you torment him, with precisely the amount of money that will result in probably hours of agonizing indecision for this poor sap. You're a thirteen-year-old kid, for Christ's sake. You're going to stand here and use your extravagant wealth to teach this simple-minded amphibian a harsh lesson in money management? How quickly one slips into the mindset of the upper class upon finding a bit of money in one's pocket. What's next, John? Will you be preaching the virtues of conservative economic policies to the citizens of this poor, working-class village? Or maybe John is just playing one of his funny pranks here. That could be it. Maybe the truth is that wealthy conservative individuals are really just great pranksters. Ah, I see you would like some of my money? Well, the joke's on you, because...you can't have it! ;-) \n\n>08:10 The other salamander should have taken some tips from this guy. It turns out John is incredibly easy to trick into giving up all his money, if you know the right hustle. But this salamander made the mistake of low-balling John out of the gate, and then raised the price when he realized he had a sucker on the line. But not even John is that dumb. Still, this guy did an awful lot better than the other guy, who will probably die of starvation before he decides how to spend that measly 100 boondollars.\n\n>08:16 John continues to be a prickly bastard, showing no appreciation for the incredible purchase he just made. Sure, he hates smuppets, and sure, it probably isn't really worth 10,000 boondollars. But it's all about the perceived value, John. It automatically becomes more valuable simply because you paid a fortune for it, like designer clothing. If it only cost you one boondollar, then maybe you'd be right in regarding it as something that belongs in a toilet. But for 10K? Suddenly now it feels like something that belongs in a museum.\n\n>08:25 What's the point of exploring a village if you can't do a little shopping? What stands out the most about this snack stand is how expensive the grasshopper is. I think that raises a lot of important questions... \"DOES it, though?\" Okay, who said that. WHO FUCKING SAID THAT? Fine, hot shot. You think you're so cool? Why don't YOU write the author note for this page? Here, I'll get you started. \"Hi, I'm a random clown, and I think my opinions are sooooo much better than those of the guy who made this thing. I'm not even the slightest bit curious about that grasshopper, or its exorbitant cost, because apparently I think I'm too cool for school. Most things aren't really a big deal to me? I kind of shrug my way through life, even when I see amazing shit. Like when a great webcomic man shares his deeply insightful thoughts about his work, or when I encounter expensive grasshoppers that have no explanation at all. I guess that's just how I roll as a person? In summary, I guess you could say, I'm not a piece of shit at all.\" Wow, great work, man. People are going to love it. And here I was, all set to write a master's thesis on all the secrets of the snack stand grasshoppers, but I guess there's no need to do that anymore. The fans will like what you had to say so much better!\n\n>08:44 This consort says that the Heir will lead them all to a \"beautiful place.\" Now that we know the full arc of this legend, we have to wonder what place he's talking about. The metarealm (i.e. \"heaven\") where John releases the fireflies? Or the universe the kids create, resulting in a home for the \"paradise\" planet, Earth C? Like most prophesies, you can make more than one answer fit. Allowing more than one viable answer for any given prophecy is very important to prophetic practice, because it provides a variety of escape hatches to ensure that the prophet does not get bit in the ass by his own egregious bullshit.\n\n>09:05 [Book relevant commentary] At one point, we could also examine the well and look inside, which was a panel that didn't make the cut here. It zoomed into the dark hole and we could hear ominous Typheus sounds, which were just orca noises. What was the point, you ask? Don't ask. If we go down that road, I'd probably have to just admit this entire RPG page didn't serve much of a purpose, and we probably could have skipped right to the Quest Bed scene without losing much. And then, where does it stop? We could probably dispense with the entire story. It's not like it's ever done anyone any good. Has Homestuck ever fed a hungry person? Cured a disease? Hell, no. It is settled then. Let's do away with all stories. Pack it in, folks. Art is canceled. All because you were curious about some orca noises.\n\n>09:26 John is really raking in the puppet ass today. I wonder what Vriska is thinking as she watches all these time-wasting shenanigans? The question is ridiculous, of course, because there's no way she isn't fast-forwarding through all this nonsense to get to the Quest Bed part. She likes John and all, but not this much.\n\n>09:30 Part of checking back on LOWAS activity now and then is just noticing how some of John's mundane objects seeded around the countryside have essentially taken hold as memes. One guy put on John's shitty, rumpled top hat, and now hats are all the rage, not to mention lavishly marked up for retail. This trend sort of continues in the alpha session, when Derse under the Condesce regime starts following similar viral fashion trends. This probably means there's something inherently alluring about the idea of rumpled headwear to simple-minded beings.\n\n>09:40 Here John goes again, being a cheap bastard. It's almost easy not to notice what a tightass he is, because you get distracted by the nice gesture and how much the salamander appreciates it. But if you're alert, you notice John gives only 1,000 boondollars, which is just barely enough for the cheapest Rumpled Head Object in the store. Just 2,000 boondollars would have bought an Even Rumplier Head Object, and a measly 5,000 would have snagged The Rumpliest Head Object Of All. John could have sprung for a top-of-the-line head object for this guy without breaking a sweat. But he didn't. So disappointing.\n\n>10:39 Dude still doesn't get it, even when John blurts it out. The truth is, the consorts are probably programmed to recognize the Heir only once they see him in the full pajama getup. Otherwise, he could beat them over the head with a log and shout \"I AM THE LEGENDARY HEIR OF BREATH!\" and they would still be like, \"Gosh, I can't WAIT for the Heir to arrive and save us from this log-wielding hooligan!\" I think this makes sense, as it provides a better NPC environment for the player and encourages him to keep growing, keep striving to advance through his quest and fully realize his role as an Heir. If the villagers started celebrating his Heir status too early, it might go to his head.\n\n>10:45 Here's the first concrete evidence that fraymotifs are actual game constructs that players can acquire and use. I believe they were mentioned at least once earlier, though when things are mentioned offhand, you can frequently write them off as whimsical gags or small points of worldbuilding that might not receive further development. But these do, and are presumably some sort of cool spells or battle techniques that you can buy in a shop. The astronomical prices suggest they're late-game maneuvers you can start incorporating into your tactics once you can afford them. And the dual aspect symbols in the shop menu imply the stronger ones are combination attacks. I think I imagined this battle concept much earlier in the story, when the kids' musical interests were more pertinent, and conceived some vague idea that combined their aspect powers with something musical in nature, like playing a song that results in a strong magical attack. Aside from this little shop menu here, mentions of fraymotifs throughout the story are exceedingly rare. There's a brief shot in a smaller panel of Dave and Jade using one later in this act, and that's it. You have to wait until [S] Collide to see a few of them in action, in an actual animated setting. Frankly, they were never even invented to be shown on-screen in an explicit way. I considered their appearance in Collide as sort of bonus material, like throwing a bone to anyone who remembered these were a thing. The point of hinting at a system like this is to capture the imagination—to let readers speculate about what these mysterious things could be and how they might be used in a typical session—and not so much to provide a concrete indicator of what's to come. In short, it's more background lore in a story where stuff like this is fun to think about, but not the real focus.\n\n>11:01 This is the end of the game. Unlike the first RPG minigame, which was somewhat open-ended and directionless, this one has a clear endpoint. From now on, the main goal of playing these games all the way through is to achieve the practical purpose of knowing what note they end on, so that when you turn the page, it actually makes sense and you know what's going on. If you got fed up with this nonsense only halfway through and clicked the next page, you wouldn't really have any context for John sitting down on that stone, bed-like slab. Playing through an entire game becomes the process for consuming an entire page, resulting in unbroken continuity. For the most part, this leads to a pretty decent and fun media experience that slows down the standard pacing a little but otherwise isn't too clunky. Of course, this all breaks down once the Meenahbound monsterpieces start dropping like bombs in the heart of the Act 6 badlands."

And then it stupidly seems to be effective as such a gesture, because we just can't seem to stay mad at Vriska. Nor should we.\n\nVriska sounds a little bitter about the fact that when she \"had to do this,\" it involved slowly bleeding out while still conscious, psychically demanding that Tavros kill her, and when he hesitated, psychically controlling him to spell out the command to kill her in her own blood, and then eventually in his own blood too when his fingers got raw and wounded from painting too many blood-letters on a rough stone surface. Which probably wasn't at the top of her list of \"fun activities for couples.\" She knows John basically needs to be euthanized for this to work. Quietly in his sleep is a nice way to go about it.

I'm guessing the next book should take us all the way through to [S] Cascade, or the End of Act 5. I sure hope it does, because having the second of two sub-acts end up spanning THREE books frankly sounds like the height of idiocy. And the LAST thing I want Homestuck to be associated with is the height of idiocy. As a closing thought, if I may remark upon the death of John here, some believed that killing off the protagonist of the story at this stage was quite a bold choice. And they were absolutely right. But it's one of those things you can only pull off if you're truly an avant garde storyteller who fearlessly defies narrative formula and all the safe choices in media. But as the loyal fans would see, it made perfect sense to kill John here. The surrounding narrative and cast are more than strong enough to stand without him. They use his memory as a motivating force to drive them to triumph, glory, personal growth, and overwhelmingly satisfying character arcs. At the end of the story, they would all look back on this moment, as would the readers, and see it as kind of an emotional turning point. A massive tone shift in the story, where it was casting off the safety of the known and charging deep into the thick underbrush of the storytelling wilderness. Every now and then we'd get a little flashback, of Rose for instance, remembering some heartfelt and uplifting advice John once gave her. It seemed so crazy to everyone that I would coldly take John out here, without ceremony or even much surrounding explanation. But in hindsight, you'll scarcely be able to find a single reader who wouldn't admit that when all was said and done, it just plain worked. Tune in next book, when we take our first cautious steps into this brave, new Johnless Homestuck. And if you feel nervous or afraid, just remember that I will be with you, holding your hand every step of the way down here in the laugh gutter. Except it won't be the laugh gutter anymore, because it's time to get serious. From now on, it will be the sobbing trough, a deep recess for our most potent feelings of melancholy and sorrow. No more jokes, no more goofs, just a bunch of stone-faced, hard-hitting shit, as Act 5 Act 2 hits a new tonal gear. I'm preparing myself as we speak. My life coach and priest have finally caught up with me, and they've brought along a brand-new friend: my exorcist. I hit the Yankee Candle store earlier and bought a few dozen wax fatties, borrowed a straightjacket from my former psychiatrist's widow, and now I'm ready for whatever happens next. Are you?"

          "content": "Welcome to the sixth book of the printed edition of Homestuck. Which is the second book of the second sub-act of Act 5, which is a bad sentence that I regret typing. That means this sub-act (Act 5 Act 2) will likely span three books when all is said and done. In the final note of the previous book, I said it would be the height of idiocy if that happened. So welcome to the height of idiocy, I guess. We're going to be spending so much time up here, we really should be racking up frequent flyer miles. I remember that while I was making Homestuck, I'd think about future arcs sometimes and speculate how many pages it would take to finish those arcs. Usually I would underestimate the pages needed, often by a pretty wide margin. So it looks like I'm right back to doing that, but with book pages instead of site pages. I figured Book 6 might take us all the way to [S] Cascade, but nope, I was way off about that too, it seems. I think I keep underestimating how much paper these playable games consume. Still, it's a fairly nostalgic feeling to revisit the practice of laughably underestimating how many real pages are consumed by certain projected arcs, even if there isn't much excuse for it this time—you know, considering the content ALREADY EXISTS. To save myself any additional future embarrassment, I'm now going to predict that Act 6 will actually need 100 books to get through. That way we will likely undershoot that projection by a lot, and everyone can come away feeling pleasantly surprised. (Flash forward to the opening note of Book 134...) \"Hey folks, It's me again. Welcome to...halfway through Act 6 Act 5 Intermission 3? I think??? Hoo BOY is there egg on my face this time.\"\n\nWait, I got so whipped up about some pointless shit, I almost didn't notice that we are jumping right into a very cool and serious Flash animation that is worth talking about. Maybe instead of parading down here all day long in the bottom margin like a dithering fool, I could actually...critically discuss my work with you, the loyal reader? Amazing thought. In the final note of the last book, not only did I egregiously misrepresent the length of the rest of the act, I also styled on you all about how John died forever, as one of my bolder creative choices. If you're new around here, let me fill you in: that was more horseshit. Of course John's going to stick around. He has been designated as the protagonist, and therefore he must persist until the end, even if he is just a very impressionable doofus who isn't particularly good at or interested in doing anything all that heroic, ever. Nevertheless, like the good trooper he is, he just keeps trucking along with Homestuck for better or worse, just like you.\n\nSo that means obviously John was going to come back to life. We knew this already because he had some temporal armor, if you want to be a big nerd about it. Which is to say, the panel we saw earlier of a John from the future wearing a nice pair of blue pajamas still needs to be explained. So instead of this being a power move—chopping down the hero of this story forever and thus dramatically increasing the power of \"character death\" and the stakes surrounding it—this scene serves the exact opposite purpose by introducing yet another cheap way that these kids are allowed to play the Get Out Of Death Free card, thereby gradually eroding the threat of death into something that becomes farcical and meaningless. BUT! There is rarely that which is sacrificed which does not involve equivalent exchange. Indeed, it appears \"sacrifice\" is a concept that is closely tied to this process on a mythical basis. But more about that momentarily. What is gained in exchange for the gratuitous cheapening of death in this case is an entire sweet power-up system involving kickass pajamas, cool titles associated with one's class and aspect, rad aspect-based powers, and some fairly dubious conditions for immortality. [S] JOHN. RISE UP is our formal introduction to god tier mode, which hereafter shall come to be recognized as an absolute staple upgrade within the comic's lore, or otherwise regarded as \"super, duper Homestuck-y.\"\n\nThere's a lot to say about god tier mode: its rules, the way it's used in the story, its symbolic features as a transformation taking place in a coming-of-age story. Maybe I'll pace myself, and not dump every last iota of analysis on you right away. I need to keep some powder dry for later, or I'll run out of shit to say on page 40. And then you'll need to listen to my completely irrelevant jokes for the next several hundred pages, and obviously nobody wants that. Before it's already over, I should say something about this animation. This is the segment that \"reveals\" the god tier transformation and shows how it happens: first, through sacrifice of the real self on a Quest Bed. Then the dream self (if still alive) transports to a corresponding Quest Bed on the Battlefield. The dream self's wounds (the same wounds incurred by the real self) are healed, and there you have it: your \"extra life\" has been used, and you're a god tier now. I think this is one of the more successful animation segments in the story. It does a pretty good job of conveying everything I just said with visuals, and has some solid, well-measured pacing. The music also sells the mystical ambience very well. The whole thing bears a certain gravity, emphasizing the point it's supposed to deliver, which is: this is a big-deal turning point for the hero. An inspirational sort of transformation, somewhat in the standard template of a hero realizing some inner, untapped greatness, after a brief concern that he may have just bitten the dust for good. In revealing an important feature of the game that had remained hidden until now, this segment recontextualizes a lot of how we imagine the game proceeds. Now we have a new benchmark to track: when do the heroes achieve god tier (if they do at all) along the way to creating a universe? What's \"normal\" for average players, and when does it naturally fit into the playthrough? What's abnormal, and is this the only method to achieving this state? Did any of the trolls reach god tier and just haven't let on about it yet? Most of these questions get answered later on.\n\nThere are a lot of magical things that happen in this story. The lore runs very deep, and it's checkered enough to foster that feeling of mystery and wonder you sometimes get that makes you think: did a wizard write this? Okay, maybe you never once had that thought. The point I'm trying to make is, achieving god tier status is EXTRA magical. What does this actually mean? Possibly nothing at all. But let's pretend it did mean something. After all, pretending as hard as you can is what magic is all about. John's transformation is radiating so much raw magical energy, even his friends take notice from afar. It's like sensing a massive boost in someone's power level. Except instead of power, the feeling they get is pure enchantment. His resurrection is so magical, in fact, that his new body seems to be ground zero for some sort of explosive phenomena that scatters millions of fluffy dust motes of shimmering magic, which then float down to the other planets. This helps the other kids know beyond a shadow of a doubt that something magical is happening up there, just in case any of them are a little dense when it comes to sensing cosmic pseudo-religious events. Dave, I'm looking at you.\n\nNow we know of two ways a resurrection can happen by utilizing the dream self taking over as the real self: a kiss from another player, or the god tier sacrifice. The latter obviously is presented with a lot more grandeur, as made clear by this animation, and also by John's awestruck posture as he checks out his handsome new jammies. The kiss method of revival feels like a more casual method. Less fanfare, more abrupt, and often invoked in a comical manner (see [S] Dirk: Synchronize and [S] Dirk: Unite). Another way to distinguish the two methods is seeing the kiss as more of a storybook device (as in Snow White or Sleeping Beauty), whereas god tier revival has more religious overtones. It begins with dying on a bed designed to look like a stone slab one might imagine being used for a ritual sacrifice in some ancient spiritual practice. This results in a literal ascension to godhood, with certain immortality conditions and a full realization of latent mystical abilities. It calls to mind any spiritual tales revolving around divine resurrection, probably most notably the one Christianity is based on. In that way, I guess you could look at John as a Christ figure in the story. Which is an assessment I might agree with, except for the fact that there is a much more obvious Christ figure who appears later in this act. His Christly parallels are actually so obvious, it is hard to avoid concluding the intent is to be comical in its egregiousness. Here I go again, writing another installment of my grand master's thesis to help confirm that, yes, the things in Homestuck you suspected were stupid jokes were, in fact, stupid jokes all along. But I guess the bottom line here is: Sorry, John, despite this really impressive thing you just did here, you still don't get to be Homestuck's Jesus.\n\nPoor WV can only watch helplessly as his dear old friend, that windy boy he once met hundreds of years ago, dies on this slab covered in Serenities. WV understandably has no way of connecting this death to John's appearance in blue pajamas on the Battlefield, which is where WV met him. If I had included the Homestuck books in that secret compartment instead of the Human Etiquette book, WV would actually know what's going on instead of believing that, as far as he can tell, this is the moment John dies for good. Then, as if to rub salt in the wound, WV catches one final glimpse of Bec Noir standing murderously triumphant over the body. It's as if Noir is staring directly through the screen and asking with an ice-cold glare at WV, \"Are you next?\" (yes, he is). Then the screen goes dark. From this we can conclude these monitors only show the player's activity right up to the moment the real self dies. They don't keep tracking the resurrected dream self when it takes over. Have I contradicted this rule anywhere? Consider it extra credit if you can spot such an instance. Then write down the page number of the gaffe, put it in an envelope addressed to me, and flush it down the toilet.\n\n[S] JOHN. RISE UP took place on day 612 of Homestuck, which was on 12/16, which is another near-permutation of the number 612. Magic numbers were coming fast and furious back in those days, almost in a way that defied logical explanation. Rarely did a magic number go by, either a special date or day count, where I didn't also push some special content on that day. Like Jack ascending or John rising up."

That's just how it goes. You see, god tier mode is only new to you, through its recent revelation. But obviously it was a feature of Sburb all along, and therefore could have been mentioned at any time by others who knew about it, such as the trolls. But as usual, my characters did me the tremendous favor of simply neglecting to mention something until it was ready to be revealed in grand fashion. It's really great having such cooperative OCS.

But the natural result of revealing something that existed all along is that we logically must spend some time \"catching up.\" Since Vriska knew about god tier mode, it stands to reason Terezi did too.

Now it's Terezi's turn to harangue her Boy Of Choice into the same thing. The Scourge girls continue their pattern of taking very different approaches with their proxy-boys. Vriska's tone was a little sycophantic and patronizing, \"allowing\" John to go to sleep of his own free will, and \"sparing\" him the knowledge that he was about to be murdered in bed. Terezi takes the opposite approach. She continues with her relentless teasing and assigns Dave the explicit objective of murdering himself in bed, leaving nothing to the imagination about what's happening here. She also seems to be daring him to do it, like \"What's the matter, Dave? PTSD MUCH?\" Which maybe comes across as additionally cruel since, as Dave points out here, she knows in advance exactly what's going to happen, whether he does it or chickens out. She's talked to him enough by now that she knows what his issues are, and so which buttons to push. Relatedly, hopping back to the previous page: Dave's indecision over his brutal self-slaying is visually paired with more thematic thrashing between broken and unbroken sword imagery, as if his toggling between the two broken states of his sword reflects his mental toggling between the type of hero he wants to be. Committing to this ruthless gesture may seal his fate as a hero on the path of the unbroken sword (see all my longposts about this in the previous book). He lengthens his sword for the task of the slaying as if he's aware of the meaning of this symbol. The hero who wields an unbroken sword will swallow his traumas, spill blood, and self-harm in the course of his heroic duties. Dave consistently declines to follow through on such measures. Contrast this with Dirk's \"heroic\" path, the way he operates, and how he notably has an \"unbreakable\" katana."

Is she really trying to antagonize Dave, aggrieve him by pushing his trauma buttons, and use him as a boy-pawn to indirectly compete with Vriska? Or is she sympathetic to him, wary of upsetting him more than necessary, but nevertheless caving in to his demands about what he needs to be doing, which inevitably results in unsettling his traumas anyway?

But let's not soil a perfectly good and interesting metaphysical discussion between two good characters by mentioning the names of certain bad juggalo characters. Then Dave calls out her Two-Face shtick. In the Hivebent book I pointed out most trolls have certain powers or themes that were directly ripped from other figures of pop culture, in particular characters from the superhero genre. Most of the time it's something incredibly on the nose. For example, Sollux's eyebeams are unmistakably Cyclops, Nepeta's claws are unmistakably Wolverine. Terezi has a funny combo of Daredevil (blind, red-eyed, lawyer vigilante), and Two-Face, the coin-flipping madman nemesis of Batman. Both characters are directly involved with the brutal dispensation of justice, one from a heroic angle, the other villainous. Two-Face was a once-upstanding district attorney who went off the deep end after his facial half-disfigurement and started doling out \"justice\" according to the whims of his coin, which was very similar in design to the one shown above. These ideas seem like a straight rip from those characters, but usually I tried to put a sort of unique spin on those elements that would make them more suitable to the themes of the character. One consistent theme with Terezi using her coin to determine the fate of others is that both forks in the road usually lead to the same grim consequences, since as she likes to say, \"luck doesn't actually matter.\" (See the end of the conversation.) The first time is during Lemonsnout's trial, when she maniacally and disingenuously ignores the flip result due to being \"blind,\" thus revealing the execution verdict was always a fixed outcome. There's a similar outcome here, where the coin flip just creates two parallel Dave timelines, and both converge into this one macabre outcome, leaving Dave with a choice that isn't even a real choice. And finally, all this coin stuff culminates in the way Terezi ends up bringing Vriska to justice, which is also presented as a choice that isn't really a choice—and for Terezi, it's the toughest non-choice of all."

I know I've been getting a lot of mileage out of this bottom margin, but in this case I might have to cry uncle and just let some of the Good Shit go unsaid.

Again, these are visual refrains, like musical phrases repeated deliberately in different contexts to remind you of themes. Before it was Davesprite, warrior on the path of the unbroken sword, outwardly protecting a more innocent sleeping version of Dave. Here it's \"Real Dave,\" with a recently toggled unbroken sword, contemplating whether he should take the plunge into this harsh path of heroism by sacrificing an innocent sleeping Dave on a rather serious-looking religious altar. Committing to such a gesture would involve killing his innocent self, signifying an obvious psychological point of no return.\n\nNote how Terezi keeps dodging the subject of which troll (Vriska) made it to god tier. (It's Vriska.) This is just the story being cagey about an issue which readers are almost certainly wondering about, now that they know god tier is a thing you can be. (Vriska became a god tier but she's hiding it.) Sometimes Homestuck does this, dangling certain info (Vriska) on a string and playing keepaway, which is partly frustrating but also partly a signal that the topic is likely something the story will get around to revealing one way or another (Vriska's the god tier). And because it's a dangle of that sort, it also increases the likelihood in your mind that at least one troll (Vriska) is going to be retroactively revealed as god tier rather than none, because if it ended up being none, why would it be dangled in the first place at all?

Red Sleeve Dave we know to be visually anchored to \"Dave on Jade Duty\" thanks to the convenient wardrobe changes I assigned to distinguish the Daves from various points across time. This marks the beginning of that phase for him. We're still aggressively hopping around the timeline of the story, just as Dave seems to be doing. But before he takes his Jade-cation, we need to wind this conversation down. The rest of it here involves some discourse on the Mind aspect, which a lot of this conversation has been about already. They also cover some of the challenges associated with the Time aspect, which appear to be closely related to issues of Mind. This is what we start learning about the aspects. There's a lot of thematic crossover between them, which has a way of drawing the Fandom Analysts into the temptation of trying to make sense of it all or to \"crack the system.\" That challenge is available, but definitive and fully comprehensive answers to everything about classpects are never provided by the text, nor should they be. Only bits and pieces for you to contemplate, which is the main value of presenting the system in this way, as I see it. To capture the imagination, and invite the reader to use their own sense of deduction and creativity to map out a bigger, deeper system to explore. Some might extrapolate on this position and decide this is a more enticing approach to worldbuilding in general than using exhaustive, brute-force methods. Regardless, there is some supplemental material on classpect data which does exist out there, and which I did have a hand in producing. But I'd rather not cite much of that here. For the purpose of these notes, I still think it's better to emphasize the Truth Of Homestuck as a function of what exists within the text, and less about handcuffing the devoted reader's understanding to the myriad extracurricular caches of content floating around the cosmos. That's how you drive people insane, and obviously that's the last thing I'd want to be responsible for.\n\nNow they're invoking the highly cursed name of Ricky Schrodinger, which I guess should actually be spelled Schrödinger, but whatever. Way back (in the last book) when the adventures of Daverezi were more about funtimes rather than edgytimes, Terezi threw some dancing Schroders at Dave in quite a playful and hilarious way. But that doesn't mean all the Schroder bullshit wouldn't be chucked into the story blender just like everything else always is, and resurface later as a grotesque, re-amalgamated narrative constituent to function as a symbolic Franken-totem in the rollout of Dave's longer arc, a figure that synthesizes a sort of platonic coolkid persona with the widely referenced quantum mechanical dual-state of mortality captured by the Schrödinger's cat paradox. Dave's condition of being alive or dead, as tied to a coin flip and other such arbitrary factors and decisions, is inextricably tied to his identity. The decision he makes is what collapses the wave form dictating his life or death, and these circumstances are also true of his heroic path, which could similarly be viewed as a wave form. Then, as if this Schrodinger boondoggle wasn't enough of a kick in the nuts, Terezi drops what seems to be the heavy line here. At least it's delivered that way, even if it's not that clear to the reader why this statement about luck is profound or significant. But one thing we do know is that bringing luck into the conversation is a surefire way to make us think about Vriska, and that maybe Terezi is knowingly referencing Vriska as well. Luck is a very Vriska-coded concept by now. So when we hear Terezi mention it, we know the thought of Vriska can't be far from her mind, and many of the things she was just saying to Dave probably have a lot of pertinence to her troubled relations with Vriska. Speaking of which, here's the 8ad 8itch herself, right on the next page. I guess you could almost say...this was a deliberately chosen transition device? Crazy. But before we trudge through the grueling nastytimes of that scene, what does this final money-line even mean? Can it be distilled with just couple more lines in this note? All right, let's try this out: Terezi saying luck doesn't matter explicitly conveys, almost through a mindful force of assertion, a diminishment of luck's relevance. It therefore corresponds to a diminishment of Vriska's relevance, which, as we know, might as well be her kryptonite. That's basically what Terezi is to Vriska: her one and only weakness, and not just in a tactical sense."

DD steps into that void, as if to remind this tortured kid, by troll standards at least, that if you aren't gonna kiss her then you might as well just kill her.

Humans don't really have a parallel for this. In our myths, advanced humans generally keep looking like humans. When Superman got his superpowers he was still basically the same human-looking guy. When Neo became The One, dude was still just Neo, but he could suddenly kick guys hella hard. When Jesus resurrected he suddenly looked like...yep, it's still just Jesus. We don't seem to really intrinsically value physiological change in response to the mythological, god-like elevations of our heroic figures.

Okay, so yeah, let's say this is related then. Also, this seems like another useless throwaway item, but often things that seem that way turn out not to be.

So technically she could have just asked a troll to check out what one of her buddies was up to. But now she doesn't have to do that, and when I say \"that,\" what I really mean is, I don't ever have to bother showing her do it. I can take shortcuts to presenting characters achieving certain objectives, to truncate actions which are ordinarily more detailed, or involve rendering non-trivial things. That's what a lot of alchemy is about, from a process standpoint. It's about consolidation. Which is one reason why the characters get these funny, hands-free computing devices. Not just because it's fun, or convenient for the character, but because it's also convenient for me to convey in panels. It gives them the option of walking around and performing other actions while they talk, so I can show more stuff while these big conversations are happening, which ends up being a more efficient way of combining certain kinds of visual action and moving the story along. That stretch where I kept upgrading the alchemiter to be an all-in-one utility was another good example of functional consolidation, eliminating the need for the character to jump through a lot of hoops to make stuff. You can wonder why I make a lot of decisions and understandably boggle at some of the choices in Homestuck, but the simple act of functional compression so as to make the basic mechanisms of storytelling more efficient was always a big factor at any given point. I kept collapsing certain concepts, processes, even entire narrative strokes so as to continually increase the length of the strides the story was taking, which allowed it to keep moving toward bigger and bolder things."

Future knowledge of the story can have kind of a distorting effect on some of this earlier content that was dedicated to nursing along big mysteries. We (assuming you're a devout Homestuck scholar like me) take lots of foreknowledge for granted. Like the Alpha Kids, and the facts that Jade's dumbass grandpa is a kid in a rebooted version of the universe, his name is Jake, and he's the actual penpal. But right now, we know none of that, and we don't know the Scratch is a huge universal reboot that will shuffle the target destinations of all the slime babies. So consider how wide open everything feels now. Revealing that Jade's penpal \"J\" is her grandson, as reported by him, really fires up the imagination. At this point it seems the most likely conclusion an uninitiated reader would draw is that this is just a literal truth being stated. I seem to remember fandom at the time regarding that as likely. Which means at some point, all these kids are successful, they grow up, Jade has kids, then her kid has \"J,\" and he penpal-collabs with her back in time to make a robo-bunny. It really fleshes out a future portrait of the story which turns out to be quite deceptive. In a way, this false projection provides some glimmers of optimism that are kind of dashed by the series of brain-cramping revelations about what's actually going on here.

Currently I'm lounging in a wheelbarrow, which is very cheerfully being handled by my youth pastor, who's pushing it in the direction of a big, sturdy building, which I'm told is the place where they keep all the sane people. He's a swell guy.\n\nSometimes when somebody offers condolences because someone you know died you have to figure out something to ramble on about, which somewhat amounts to you saying \"It's nice of you to be sad.\" Dave does a pretty cool-guy job of that here. He also starts talking about the sword lodged deep in his chest and firmly stuck into the stone floor of the ruins. I think I've given you a lot of tools to parse any symbolic data when it comes to the Strider brothers, swords, their broken status, and them being stuck in things. It's another Sword in the Stone situation, with a few provisos: 1) It's a sword in a bro, not just a stone. 2) We know Dave doesn't solve that classic mythical problem in the conventional way, so pulling the sword out is going to be a problem. Not because it's impossible, but because it involves gore, and messing with an abusive guy's corpse, which suffice to say, is triggering. 3) We know Dave is meant to solve challenges of this format by breaking the sword. However... 4) Bro's katana is literally unbreakable (until proven breakable much later, under very specific conditions). So what does this all add up to, when you factor in the established language of these symbols? Maybe you can try sorting that out. I think a decent summary is this entire configuration—a dead Bro + an unbreakable sword lodged in his bloody corpse and stone edifice—is something Dave is in no way equipped to engage with. Which maybe is an obvious point? Anyway, a deep dive on this is jumping the gun, since we literally see him trying to deal with this dead Bro/sword issue later. But then he mentions the suicide plan, which suggests this triggering event is already tilting him in the direction of some depressive trains of thought. His conversations with Rose about certain things probably haven't helped much either. (You know, considering she's the one plotting the suicide mission.)"

This is actually a pretty bold move here. It shows Jade is capable of some interesting and unpredictable decisions. Earlier in the story she was phoning it in a little. Being cheerful, going through the motions, doing what she understood needed to be done due to her cloud visions. Now that she's beyond all that, she has to improvise a bit. It turns out her freestyle decisions are pretty entertaining, and involve some highly questionable judgment. Remember how I've linked her arc to a bell curve shape; it swells in the middle, and she accumulates more narrative potency as she's given more waking time and freedom.

Unlike Tavros, Dave is someone she likes and respects, so he's liable to have more influence over her thinking. Stopping Jack and protecting Dave from any additional undue dying is a factor. But why this way? Why self-prototyping? Listening to his stories about having to deal with alt-selves, especially his own self-prototyping episode, is likely the influence here. On a metatextual level, introducing some parallelism for Davesprite via Jadesprite, thereby providing a future foil for Davesprite's unique plight, was one good reason for spiking this into the story. You see them get together later for some critical Sadstuck moments, which obviously sets up Jade's Witch tier ascendance too. Aside from that, it's just tossing another splinter into the works, which at this point is becoming a standard operating procedure for Homestuck. And when in doubt on why that's a thing we're doing at any given moment, just retreat to the safe standby explanation: introducing splinters helps us get to know characters better by revealing new facets of their personalities. The melodramatic conversation they're about to have is probably one of the first really overt examples of this in action."

Jade used to \"become\" the dream self every time she took a nap. So in that way, they weren't two separate people, just two bodies sharing one consciousness, depending on which one was awake any given moment. But the weird thing about this is, the moment Dream Jade died, she became a separate person, from the perspective of her continued existence in the afterlife. Meanwhile Real Jade just kept on living her life, totally unaware of Dream Jade's journeys through the dream bubbles. But now she's back. She has all the same memories Jade has, right up to the point of her dream self's death. Then she gained a whole lot of new memories from the afterlife, creating a divergence, and an entirely separate individual and personality. A lot like Davesprite, who also is a copy of Dave up to a certain point, then diverges for a few months of living in a different timeline. So it's a true personality splinter: a version of Jade who is similar, but different enough to provide interesting contrasts due to differing experiences.

The destruction of cue balls is a thematically relevant proposition when it comes to the rise of English. So I guess I'm going to the bother of saying all this because the presence of this spherical lab as a cue ball stand-in is a visual anchor that foreshadows this terrible transmutation. /Takes deep breath because there's so much more bullshit to say about everything./ ANYWAY.

The next level up the ladder in the brain meme on this is, wait a minute, it turns out Gamzee is crazy and murderous, and just stinks up the rest of the story, never going anywhere, never dying, always in the wrong place at the wrong time ready to fuck up the plot by doing something random and stupid. So he's actually a lot more important than this gag would make it seem at this moment. But the MOST important character? Okay, stay with me, there just keep being layers to this. During [S] Cascade, when the nature of this critical moment is fully revealed, the camera pulls back from this shot a bit, and we see Lil Cal sitting there with Gamzee, watching the ball drop. So that retroactively tells you that the \"most important character\" line could with equal likelihood be referring to Gamzee or Cal. We know Cal is a key component of Doc Scratch, and in that very animation we learn Doc is basically just Lord English waiting to emerge, and English is seemingly the ultimate source of evil and adversity behind everything in the story.

So we might as well take a break and go full Stupidstuck, and watch me fool around in my recently green-painted mansion while wearing Lord English's huge coat. The \"Who is Lord English\" question has been picking up steam, which means it's time for me to waltz into the story and fuck with you a little on that subject. There are some clues that we're circling this topic that were hard to appreciate at the time. Gamzee is watching the ball drop during the critical moment, which circumstantially coincides with the rise of LE. We don't have all the info yet, but that was a subtle prompt to consider the question, which I'm doing here. Mainly by \"reassuring\" everybody that I'm not going to turn out to be LE himself and become the supreme villain that my fictional heroes all have to gang up on and defeat in the end. If that were literally true, then yes, I would be right in describing that here as \"dumb.\" But then again, you can never totally trust me, can you? This is just some farcical misdirection-slash-admission in plain sight, which is a frequent tool of the story. LE arguably is me, but detached from the literal AH persona by several layers of symbolism and exaggerated, shithead, in-story avatar composites, to create the ultimate anti-narrative, anti-reader, anti-Homestuck monstrosity. Implacable and invincible. So invincible that, even in a state of imminent defeat, his death can't be shown, because...why would he \"give\" that to you? But getting into any of that would be skipping too far ahead to Act 7 meta. For now, this just reads as more self-insert buffoonery. It takes a very long time for all of this symbolism to become manifest. (Though for the record, when it finally does, I consider the conclusions about LE as a complex, wrathful, multi-faceted author avatar to be pretty evident. I don't think I'm spilling much Hot Dirt here.) At this stage, it's all hard to see, and the true identity of LE feels like an important piece of info we're waiting for, which means it can be trollishly teased in this manner. It also feels kind of glaring, on a reread, how baked in all this was from the start. I'm pretty sure this was the loosely intended nature of LE even when he was being alluded to in the Intermission. The way that true nature was eventually presented (for instance, the Arquiusprite constituent) is what was somewhat freestyled along the way. Naturally, when you joke about an outcome (\"how stupid would that be?\" ) it takes a little heat off the suspicion of that outcome. Probably even AH, the character here, doesn't have the slightest idea what LE's true nature is. He's not even really me. He's semi-me, an in-story projection of AH the buffoon, the megalomaniac \"godhead\" who goofs around, and on some level knows he's just a flailing clown at the mercy of the thing he's making, as much as its creator. He's sort of an innocent victim of this endeavor, almost as much as other characters are. He can't possibly \"fill the coat\" of LE in this form. Few can. Even someone with AH's proclivities, author-tier powers, and a nefarious agenda like Doc Scratch can't fill the coat. That's why I'm \"swimming in this garish piece of shit.\" The coat is another loaded symbol. Something terrible needs to happen, and the monster needs to surface. Yes, he may be \"already here,\" but it's just not time yet."

It's an idea imported from Problem Sleuth, with object-duality properties—at times it's a coat, and at other times it's a sarcophagus. In PS, the Chicago Overcoat was the final boss's method of transport (a pirate ship) and was also an old mobster term for a coffin. When I adapted this idea for Lord English, I made both the coffin and overcoat parts of the euphemism literal, by making it a dual-state coat/sarcophagus. Okay, whew, that was an explanation, but these are the most trivial things to say about the coat. Because I seem to be making a big deal about it in this scene, you know some other stuff is going on with it. First, it's just indicative of the fact that we're waiting for LE. An empty wrapper, ready to be filled. And since it's also a vessel, his chariot awaits. The eerie, blue inner lining? The coat is yet another metafictional construct. The blue lining is something I contrived to serve as a visual barrier between characters in the story, and things happening on the other side of the 4th wall, i.e. the \"real\" (fakereal) world. I put the coat up on the wall to block them from seeing any obtrusive, distracting nonsense on my side of the wall that would mess with your suspension of disbelief too much (I get into this issue more directly later with a really bad \"pledge\" written in SBaHJ-style font and artifacts). The consequence of this is, from the character's POV, the 4th wall appears to emulate a \"blue screen of death\" type of computer crash. It mimics a simple terminal glitch, which can be written off as an innocent technology malfunction. The truth though has more to do with the properties and symbolism of the coat itself. \"Why don't we get back to what's happening on the other side of the coat\" is the line that leads back into the story action. Which implies that the coat functions as sort of a delineating barrier between one sort of reality and another. Which the 4th wall already was, but the coat added another non-permeable layer to the dividing plane. It's like a sort of membrane, producing an almost electrostatic buffer that shields one field of narrative potential from another. And if AH understands this on some level, then he's making some (for now) good faith effort to insulate the narrative from this 4th wall meta-fuckery. But the shielding can only last as long as LE himself has not been summoned yet, and is not wearing the coat, which would remove it from the wall (this happens in [S] Cascade, conveniently just before Jade's golden ship crashes through the wall to traverse between sessions, or narrative realms). And since this construct is associated with LE, its partitioning effect also has some insidious implications. As a supreme author-tier villain who wears this thing, its insulating, enveloping effect serves to keep him detached and distinct from the narrative field which he terrorizes. In his absence, it seems I'm \"unwittingly\" using it to envelop the narrative itself, starting now. It's almost like the story is now wearing the coat. And as a result, he's managing to stake a sort of claim over it. As if to say, this is mine, or intrinsically consists of me and my evil desires. The story is keeping my coat warm until I'm able to fill it physically. And now is also the moment where Doc is beginning to become more aggressive in directly pulling the strings on the story to bring about the emergence of his master. It seems like poor AH here doesn't know what he's doing when he's doing this, but clearly I did. This is about as illustrative as anything of the fact that there's a significant difference between AH the character and AH the author."

This moment where I'm sort of pretending to be him, typing in his white text while also getting more whimsical and appearing to take my duties as an author less seriously, is just another leg in AH's long journey where he transitions from \"the author as a limited, goofy, fallible human being\" to \"the author as a nefarious, destructive, non-human entity, which thrives in his absence, if not outright trying to kill/replace him, and itself has several different forms.\" Stuff like this generally tends to read as more stupid monkey business, but the individual segments start making a lot more sense when you start reading them as installments of \"the increasingly derelict, maniacal author is gradually phasing himself out of control over the story, and/or is BEING phased out of control over the story by dark forces beyond his control.\""

I'm starting to think this isn't making any sense. But that has never stopped me from explaining a bunch of additional shit, such as the symbolic meaning of this technicolor nightmare coat I keep harping on about. Like I was saying, hanging the coat up basically BSOD'ed the 4th wall, neutralizing its meddling meta qualities because, as it says here, these poor girls are very upset and emotional. If they could see some sort of Onceler-ass orange fool in a green suit capering about, it would break the immersion and ruin the drama of the moment. So in a way this electromagnetic meta-buffering effect the coat has is just one of several token methods of authorial restraint, hampering the undesirable effects that such clownish feats of postmodernism may have on Homestuck's simple ability to tell a good story. This is an issue of some \"concern\" which pretty soon becomes more explicitly addressed as a presumed point of consternation of the reader, first by Karkat when he talks to Jade about this 4th wall, and then by me through a completely insane SBaHJ-style \"pledge.\" We'll get to that soon, and what it means and why I did it (if I can even fucking remember at this point). But for now the coat does read as this symbolic device of restraint, separating a responsibly told story from its exact opposite: the potential for all hell to break loose, metafictionally speaking. Right now the wall/story is \"wearing\" the coat in lieu of LE's immediate presence. But normally, he's the guy who wears it. When you bring its symbolic meaning back into the picture when referencing it as his garment, you could see it as a kind of skin that separates those destructive forces (embodied by himself) and the realm surrounding him (i.e. the story). In other words, the moments where he's wearing the coat are points where you could say he's \"holding back\" somewhat. And the moments where he \"disrobes\" (often by transforming the coat into a sarcophagus and busting out of it to fuck people up) is when he's \"unleashed\" in this sense. (You see him doing this in [S] Collide.) The only other time he's without the coat is when he's first summoned, but he quickly transports the coat from the 4th wall to his body. Hopefully that is the last bit of dissertation I will ever have to offer on what will EASILY end up being the most overthought, overdescribed story element in the entire book: a big, green man's dumb, ugly coat."

But more specifically, they can be a device used to reveal more about a character's negative qualities or personal struggles to themselves. This is probably the first instance where this idea is especially evident, though it's been kind of simulated through Karkat's many arguments with himself. I don't know if those \"count\" as real splinters so much as Karkat just tragically misusing time travel-enabled chat messaging. This is the real deal, though. Jade splintering herself off like this reveals flaws about both versions of them. For Jadesprite, it reveals an emotionally unstable side of her personality that's useless in a crisis. For Jade, it reveals a tendency to make rash decisions, with the cheery presumption that everything she does will work out for the best no matter what, probably because she's been conditioned to think that way due to being raised on Skaian cloud-visions. Naturally, characters don't like what's revealed about themselves when they look into these splinter-mirrors, which is why you get these heated arguments. These two, Dirk vs. AR, Vriska vs. (Vriska)... In this case it feels pretty obvious why this little intra-Jade drama was pushed into focus here. It gives Karkat the perfect material to own her with, and draws them both into a conversation enabling them to relate more closely. Which makes it probably the least surprising plot twist in the world when he intrudes on them a few pages from now.\n\nAnd the woofs begin... So, aside from the emotional dimension of this unfortunate resurrection, we also realize Jadesprite is part dog now. And knowing that Jade sort of \"fuses\" with her during her later god tier transformation, we also know that eventually Jade herself will be part dog too, basically forever. It bears keeping that in mind. I won't say exactly why just yet. It just does."

That dismal tree stump is RIGHT outside, lest you forget. Jadesprite is that emotional powderkeg of a friend who is completely inconsolable about something, and there's nothing you can do about it. It's not like Jade doesn't feel bad for her, but no amount of sympathy seems to have any effect. Jadesprite alludes to some \"friends\" she met in the afterlife who she will probably never see again, which might have garnered some additional sympathy from us.

Both we and Jade are textually correct to be frustrated with her, which justifies Jade's outburst on the next page. This is unlike the comparable example much later of Vriska vs. (Vriska), which this scene almost serves as an early prototype for. In that scene it's much harder to side with the aggressor, i.e. the \"real self\" who is lambasting the weak, emotional, dead version who fell out of narrative relevance long ago. That splinter situation exposes character flaws in almost the reverse way. Here Jade reveals a very unbecoming degree of weakness and impotence for having fallen out of the spotlight for a long time, which reads as a regression of some positive qualities she already had. Whereas (Vriska's) departure from relevance resulted in a kind of \"weakness\" which reads more as a humanizing evolution of her harsh, win-at-any-cost personality, and her \"real\" self's apoplectic rage toward those traits just highlighted the flaws her ghost allowed herself to move beyond even more.

Secondary observation: above the panels is a textual callback to Future Dave's conversation with Calsprite, who was probably a similarly obnoxious sprite, but for different reasons. Just another minor parallel between the way Dave's and Jade's sessions are going. Davesprite can relate to Jade here because, before he traveled back in time, he had to deal with a shitty sprite too.

Oh, what's that? You don't give a shit about my artistic malfunctions because you don't actually know anything about art, and wouldn't really care even if you did? Well, yeah. I could have told you that. Anyway, this is the final panel that uses this portrait template, which signifies the fact that Karkat is going to plow through a fairly heavy emotional and metaphysical conversation with the human kid he happens to have the most affinity for at the moment, which is Jade. It makes \"sense\" that this eerie, electrostatic meta-light is illuminating his face in a certain way, because he is about to provide a little insight into what's on the other side of that wall, and how \"dangerous\" it is to mess with the forces that power this device. This would seem to imply that Karkat actually knows some stuff about fourth walls, the \"real\" world on the other side, and what's going on with all that. I don't think it's ever explained at all why he knows anything about this. It would be absolutely wild for me to sit here and tell you that such an explanation exists.\n\nHere's what I believe is one of the only times when Karkat says \"fuckass,\" if not the only time ever. Yet this expletive got a bit fanonized as sort of his catchphrase. Like his \"bazinga\" or something. This is very misleading. To be fair, Jade herself probably did more than anyone to viralize this term as Karkat's battle cry, since later in this arc she seems to have been influenced by his foul language habits. I think she says it a few times when she's harassing him for passwords. And that's the story of fuckass. Not that interesting, right? Yep, moving on. Karkat shows a bit of impressive restraint here while he plays the role of Jade's therapist, but it seems like it's mainly just a rhetorical ploy to bait her into admitting her hypocrisy when it comes to her criticism of his own auto-altercation habits. But once he gets that confession from her, note how quickly he pivots from antagonism to a genuinely empathetic posture. Real empathy for other people's problems sometimes seems like the only thing he's better at than yelling, and perhaps the only thing he's good at overall. Except romance movie lore, but obviously that's fucking useless. But you can see how this all works very well as a contrivance to help them bond over something and to legitimately pull Jade out of her long-entrenched feelings of disgust for this stupid idiot. You can start seeing why it was necessary to slap so much of this together here: Jadesprite, her neurosis, and her ensuing conflict with Jade...it's all a big mess, but it's all mutually dependant and important for tying certain things together. Imagine you're watching me make this huge, shitty stew, and you see me drop a big, ugly frog in the stew. And you're like, ew dude, why'd you put that frog in there? And I just say, without breaking my stirring rhythm, he's in there to eat all the flies I put in earlier. And you're like, ohhhh, wow, that DOES make sense. Then you turn and walk away, and a minute later it occurs to you to wonder why I put flies in the stew. But by then, you don't feel like asking, because you're pretty confident I've got an answer lined up for that one too, even if it's kind of dumb. Also, you've already walked for an entire minute, you don't care that much, and somewhere in the back of your mind you've lowkey decided you probably never want to speak to me again anyway.

But there's a morsel of insight here that Jade seems to offer, which is the fact that he's pawning off responsibility on his past self and \"atones\" through conspicuous self-loathing, while assigning that loathing to a different (past) self. I've said before, on the topic of character splinters, that Karkat's practice of this is a kind of punitive, self-imposed, faux splintering. His past and future selves aren't real splinters, like Jadesprite. They're still just him, from different points on the timeline, which for convenient purposes of ludicrous self-incrimination, he targets as his number-one enemy. If you disregard the time travel component, I think this is akin to more conventional psychological defense mechanisms real people have, like a form of dissociative identity disorder. He's broken himself up into various \"identities,\" compartmentalizing them by where they are in time rather than who they are, in the same way one might in response to trauma, grief, shame, or anything else that might trigger that kind of psychological fragmentation. Whether it's this mostly comedic faux splintering or real splintering, the intent is always to point to the same thing, which is: the struggle to understand oneself is intense. Being forced to confront the multitudes one contains—the contradictions, the different facets of personality, the internal schisms—sometimes in extremely literal ways, that's what this stuff is All About, All The Time."

The \"forces\" in question are obviously just a shorthand for all the metafictional horseplay that's been going on here, which has mostly been tied to the 4th wall and my antics on the other side of it. The caution seems to pertain to a fairly confusing concern he's expressing for something like \"narrative integrity,\" which can be compromised if, for instance, a very foolish author avatar were to burst through the wall and start dancing around like a maniac, hassling all of his beloved Original Characters, thus utterly befouling everyone's precious immersion. That's probably what Karkat's warning about here, which essentially is me speaking through him, giving readers a heads-up that I'm at least alert to these issues, despite how frivolous I'm apparently willing to be with these \"forces.\" Maybe you could write this off as a fun nod toward the camera via Karkat's hysterics, which only goes as far as this page, and that's it. But no. Somewhat bafflingly, this is just prologue to a more formal \"pledge\" I write in ugly, jpegged Comic Sans during another absurd self-insert coming up soon. That pledge is the long form of this arguably unnecessary reassurance to the reader that nothing stupid will happen (stupid things still happen anyway, but that's a whole other conversation). The pledge itself is actually a pretty complicated issue which will need some 'splaining, in a way that will surely consume more words than the actual text of the pledge itself.\n\nThen we're assailed by some \"actual information.\" It happens sometimes. Jade and Karkat (well, really just Jade) cooked up this communication protocol to keep an orderly conversation rolling across time. Which is another way of saying I cooked it up, to continue with the rest of the act in a more rational manner and not worry too much about the logistics of inter-timeline communications. It helps us know that whatever's going on here, Jade is clearly up to something in the future. There's a real plan, a real purpose, which we can take some comfort in, even if we don't know what it is yet. Just like we can take some comfort in the fact that I've promised not to fuck up the story with too much meta bullshit, which I do anyway as a result of gross authorial negligence, whoops, so let's change the subject. The only concrete part of her \"plan\" we glean from this is that Jade needs to draw the 4th wall, i.e. captchalogue it for future purposes. Very intriguing. If you've seen [S] Cascade, then you know exactly what they need it for. But if you have your thinking cap on, you can start sensing what's afoot here already. The session is doomed, with an unstoppable force in Jack ruling over it. Something called a \"scratch\" is coming up, which we don't know much about, but it sounds serious. We know the 4th wall is a conduit to somewhere else, even if the realm on the other side is stupid, and we just got lectured on how we're not supposed to mess with those forces. And yet...one can't help but speculate that maybe this extra-dimensional plane she just stashed away could be used as a means of escaping a dire situation. Could that really be the case? If so, it raises so many other questions. Don't worry, I will answer all of them. Both in the story itself, as well as several additional times in these notes, rather gratuitously."

Also, on the last page we saw WQ assign PM the duty of taking down the slayer, in addition to assuming her place as the new ruler.

Is it just a fallback plan in case things don't work out the way WQ is planning here, or if Jack finds some other way to catch up with them? It seems even if WQ didn't know this plan was going to fail, she probably has an unavoidably pessimistic attitude about all this and is trying to cover all her bases. Given that she was born into a civilization that fully understands its doomed nature, a certain degree of ingrained pessimism is to be expected.

But I think more importantly than that, it uses colorful dream symbolism to let us peek into WV's psychology about his supposedly destined role and everything he's been through already. Basically, he's scared. He's already had power and responsibility thrust upon him (well, he thrust it upon himself, as a self-appointed revolutionary who was angry about his farm burning down). Wielding that responsibility got a lot of innocent Prospitians and Dersites killed, and we can see echoes of that traumatic event in his dream. He's subconsciously worrying that it's going to happen all over again. If he puts on that ring, he'll have so much power he'll have no choice but to be complicit in many deaths. Slaying Jack doesn't matter to him, only the innocent lives that will be on his conscience again. WV is not a vengeful, righteous, or revolutionary figure. Not anymore. He is only regretful and full of sorrow for the losses he's responsible for, which has probably resulted in his mild demeanor and preoccupation with more benign pursuits, such as lofty thoughts about democracy, silly model building, and chalk drawings. He also seems to be subconsciously aware that the uranium in his belly is linked to the fearsome, radioactive green sun energy the ring will grant him. It's like a poison inside him, this heroic destiny he senses. He doesn't know yet that the uranium is a key to ultimate devastation in a different way: it's Jack's ticket to the other session, a vantage point from which he can destroy the whole universe. WV's the unwitting, average fool completely in over his head, who happens to be the singular pivot point upon which the fate of trillions of lives rests. His dreaming brain senses this and responds with visions of anxiety. When you start spelling it all out like this, it sounds very similar to what Dave's going through—a trauma-driven resistance to an innately felt call toward heroism. Maybe this is why Dave ends up resonating with the Mayor so much when they finally meet later.

          "content": "We already saw Jack destroy Prospit in [S] Jade: Enter. That was a major destructive event which was situated on the timeline for a while but went unshown until it was finally featured in a murderous animation sequence starring Jack Noir. Now here's another one. This time the animation features another event we plotted on the timeline about an hour later: the destruction of Derse. We already know this kills all Derse dreamers, and also that it roughly syncs up with the explosion of Aradiabot, so we're about to see what's up with that. The 4:13:57 countdown shows we're about a minute away from that dire event, and about four hours away from the Big One, which as of now still remains a mystery. Also, upon loading, this Flash cues up the song \"Megalovania\" by Toby Fox, which, you know, at the time was no big deal. Just another cool song from the greater discography dropped into one of these animations. But then years later he used it again in Undertale, thus somewhat rebranding the public's association with it. Does that mean it's fair to say it's more of an Undertale song than a Homestuck song now? This question, of course, is completely ridiculous, since the answer is: it's neither. It still is, always has been, and always will be, a Vriska song.\n\nFef is the first to go. She suffers a similar fate to the eventual comeuppance of her scorned moirail. Is there deliberate relevance to this echo? I dunno man, to be honest, lots of folks get gruesomely bisected in this thing. If you want it to be true, feel free to believe in it. As you know by now, believing in things always makes them at least kinda true. Especially when I'm the one doing it.\n\nThere are only five towers on the Derse moon, compared to Prospit's seven. Prospit has one extra due to Sollux's binary nature, and Derse has one fewer due to Aradia's dream self being MIA from the get-go (because of her ghost). Aradia's mysterious dream self conditions, and the question of where she actually is, get addressed in a couple of pages. Only visually though, and the viewer must make some inferences on what is actually going on there. Not anymore though, because now you have me along for the ride to EXPLAIN THE LIVING SHIT OUT OF EVERYTHING!!!!! Oh yeah, also Dream Nepeta kicks the bucket, because it would be malpractice not to shoehorn in a little more dead Nepeta content.\n\nThere's a John arm there in the upper left, because why not. I didn't add them to many of the animations because it was more annoying to edit and resave Flash files than it was for simple GIF panels. But it also felt wrong to completely ignore the Flash pages during the retconned arm stunt. This seemed like a good place for one. Why? Maybe John sensed Jack's outstretched arm and thought he was going up top for a high five. It's established canon FACT that John doesn't like to leave people hanging, so let's say that's what's happening here.\n\nWe zoom way into the core of Derse to find Aradia's sleeping dream self. This is where she's been hiding all along. One simple visual provides so many answers and questions all at once, and since it's happening in a textless, rapid-fire animation, there isn't much you can do except sit there and take it like a chump, and start trying to make some inferences about what's going on here. That's okay though, I got your back this time. Having died long before they began Sgrub, Aradia is officially \"the dead player,\" and Sgrub, in its unsettling state of all-knowingness, knew this about her as well and provided some structural accomodations on Derse from the very start similar to how it accommodated Sollux's binary nature by letting him be on both moons. We know that's a Quest Slab, because we already saw Vriska's in her Quest Cocoon. This one, however, is free-floating in the center of Derse's crypt, as if it were meant to hold a long-entombed corpse. The fact that Aradia began the game as a ghost seems to have resulted in a sort of \"stillborn\" dream self, or at least one that exists in a much deeper state of sleep than usual. Whether she's dead here, or in a coma, or sort of semi-undead...that isn't totally clear, and it doesn't matter much. The only relevant fact is that Aradia was going to stay put on that slab until exactly this moment. The only way off this slab for her is for the body to be consumed in this green inferno and resurrect as a god tier player. Note her robot self explodes as a result of the destruction of the dream self, just as the death of dream Jade established in [S] Descend. Even though Aradia is a very special case (there's nothing \"normal\" about beginning a session when one of the players is a ghost), and Sgrub accommodated her specialness in this way, this also charts a secondary path to achieving god tier status. We can then start speculating there are other ways of doing this even if the standard way becomes inaccessible (such as through death of the dream self). So when we find out Rose and Dave also manage to reach god tier in a similar way in [S] Cascade, it's an exciting development but not exactly shocking. The method they use was already seeded here. There are differences, of course. Rose's and Dave's Quest Slab ascensions should be regarded as more typical of how the game works, since they're \"normal\" players. The slabs are typically found in the core of the moon, not the planet itself. Also, the dream self typically is not lying on it in a sort of coma for many years in advance. They have to actually find their way down there and complete the ritual sacrifice. See also the Alpha Kids, who all utilized this method. They had no choice, since their session didn't even have a Battlefield, which is where you're supposed to end up if you do it the way John and Vriska did.\n\nIt's a whole new Aradia. Not a moment too soon, since frankly that robot bitch was a real drag. Just kidding, she was great too. All Aradias are valid. This one just happens to enjoy a major personality boost. A reinvigoration of her true self, due to not being dead, or doomed, or carrying around the baggage of the old, toxic relationships that resulted in her death. I see this form as a much more distilled version of her personality compared to all her other phases. Unwaveringly cheerful, exhibiting a fairly \"normal\" personality, and yet still as naturally drawn toward chaos, death, and destruction as ever. It's an odd thing about her. The only other troll who rivals her in terms of sheer delight and enthusiasm derived from destruction is probably Gamzee. You'd think that wouldn't be a flattering comparison. But somehow it works for her, says me. Crack ship, anyone? Please, don't sit there and act like I couldn't have made that work. You know it would have been great. There's something about her confidence as a god tier that seems related to her unflinching infatuation with death and destruction. Here she sees Jack bearing down on her and isn't concerned at all. She had the same demeanor while watching a black hole swallow the green sun and rip apart all of reality. She's completely fearless in this form.\n\nA relentless, unshakeable sense of cheerfulness in the presence of horror is a trait Aradia shares with Gamzee. But for her, it's a positive thing. For him, it's negative. Why am I harping on this? I don't know, it's completely irrelevant. Just thought I'd point it out. After all, rams and goats are both known to be stubborn creatures. Did I actually intend for these two characters to have this in common? No, I'm not going to kid you about that. (\"Kid\" is a goat pun, and that was intended, so you're welcome.) Instead what I'll do is ram more quality analysis down your throat. (\"Ram\" was a ram pun, JSYK.) This is the third god tier we've been introduced to, and all in fairly rapid succession. One is a point, two is a line, three is a trend. So that means with this reveal in particular, the god tier stuff is starting to get very exciting. The story is paying out generously with it now, like a loose slot machine in Vegas, which makes you wonder how many more of these characters will reach this state. It stands to reason there will be more, due to the hot pace of these reveals. That assumption isn't wrong, but at the same time I tried to be somewhat judicious about not throwing too many of these out there, which would cheapen them a little. Shoving all eight human kids in pajamas by the end was probably pushing it a bit as it was. Still, as of this moment I'd say the mission is accomplished: your imagination has been successfully captured. Now you have a lot to speculate on. What do the rest look like? What are the color schemes, symbols, costume designs? Do you have enough raw material to start crafting speculative fan works, illustrations, OCS and such? (HELL YES.) Stoking the reader's imaginative fires in this way is every bit as much of the point of rolling out a system like this, as it is to serve the story's purposes.\n\nAradia shows off some powers. Turns out they're...time powers? What a twist. Then the animation flips an hour ahead, from the moment linked to the destruction of Derse, to another key moment. (Remember we saw Terezi crying and running off deeper into the lab at 3:14.) But suddenly it seems we have something else to associate with this timestamp: Vriska Time™.\n\nPer the previous notes on Aradia, and extrapolating that perhaps achieving god tier status has a way of giving the player full license to be the purest version of themselves—that is, yoloing their best and truest life possible—then maybe Vriska is taking this idea to heart as well. God tier mode seems to bring something out of her. Like she feels empowered to fully tack into her role as a completely obnoxious, overconfident luck fairy. She's just capering around, taunting Tavros, and spreading her pixie dust. But unlike Tinkerbell's, this dust won't make him fly. Or will it?! (The answer is yes, when she throws him off yet another cliff in a few moments.) She didn't just become god tier, though. That happened quite a while ago, and she's simply been hiding it because she prefers her plain clothes (and more importantly, it would have been a spoiler). So this hyperactive fairy act seems more a result of the fact that she's currently wearing the outfit, rather than an extension of the powers themselves. Sometimes certain clothes and accessories just make you feel different. Remember how Kanye said wearing the Trump hat made him feel like Superman? Whoops, it was a mistake to mention that. I apologize. My youth pastor has a big smile on his face, and he's slowly shaking his head, as if to say, yes Andrew, it certainly was. And yes, I'm perfectly aware that I shot my youth pastor and he's dead now. I simply have him propped up on my knee, and now I'm operating him like a ventriloquist's doll. This is also a fact I should not have mentioned, and he is currently scolding me for that decision as well.\n\nHere's little nod to Dave's strife with Bro, where he held up a decapitated smuppet to intimidate his opponent. The move is even less effective against Vriska as it was against Bro. She just taunts him back with his own useless pair of severed legs, which she clearly regards as a symbol for how she has a habit of repeatedly owning him, and this time will likely be no different. And also revealing to him that...she still has them for some reason? I think I made an inappropriate joke about that in the last book, and I'm being asked to apologize again. She wasn't even the one who cut off the legs. But a good thief doesn't let such a golden opportunity go to waste, does she? Maybe she even anticipated wielding the legs in a future moment just like this. The glorious moment where she foresaw herself vanquishing the loathsome villain Tavros once and for all. My hero. <3\n\nThis nifty little move Vriska pulls, and and how easily she pulls it, kind of proves how ridiculously outclassed Tavros is. Which also reveals how unnecessary the move was. Yanking the lance out of his hand, flipping it around with one hand in a split second, and then running it through the bullseye on his chest. (Which unfortunately somewhat reframes that symbol in hindsight as possibly being destined for this purpose, surprising no one because: Tavros.) If she did this, she could have done anything. Like, punch him in the face and KO him across the room for another nap at the bottom of the stairs? Or even if her intent was more brutal than that, she still easily could have stepped out of the way, smacked him in the ass, and sent him falling off the cliff without impaling him first. The pre-plummet impaling carries some additionally malicious messaging, obviously. Same deal as GAME OVER, when Gamzee did basically the exact same thing to Karkat (whose shirt also provided a couple of handy bullseyes to aim for). So why does Vriska do this? Later, she sort of admits that she got a bit carried away here. Everyone's all about to get carried away, now that we have just officially entered Murderstuck."

There was probably also a contentious conversation between them we didn't see, but it didn't really matter what they said. Murder speaks louder than words. Something kind of similar happens when Terezi confronts Vriska later. That also results in an impalement murder and has a contentious conversation leading up to it (see: [S] Flip). But a lot of that conversation is omitted, garbled, and distorted due to the game glitches that are starting to pile up. Which is a way of signaling that the conversation doesn't matter much either.

This version of Kanaya isn't supposed to talk to Jade yet, so she just ends up being confused. Jade knows not to spoil Kanaya on any privileged future info, and the conversation is then free to devolve into some inconsequential nonsense. It's not absolutely foolproof, though. For instance, a future version of Kanaya could tell a past Kanaya the password to hack the system. But that's sort of unlikely, and the system functions on the presumption that people will operate on good faith, considering...well, they're all trying to save each other's asses here, aren't they? Someone needs to take charge and enforce some order here, and right now it looks like that person is Jade. Which, in the grand scheme of things, is actually just another way in which one of Karkat's buddies manages to steal his leaderly thunder.\n\nHere's an exchange—\"GA: How Am I Supposed To Know The Password\" \"GG: because i told you\" \"GA: I Dont Remember That\" \"GG: exactly!!!!!!!!!!!\"—which now strikes me as relevant to the password system I used during Terezi and John's retcon stunt. People who've never read Homestuck will encounter those pages, which demand a password to progress, and a similar exchange could take place. On the password pages, Terezi helpfully reminds you that if you don't know the password, it means you're not supposed to know it yet, so you should just keep reading along the other branch. I doubt this was sufficient to prevent everyone from being confused by it, though. As you can see, even a smart cookie like Kanaya can get thrown for a loop by some of these nonlinear event management logistics."

It just means she turns goth as fuck and stops being visible to prying Trollian interlopers. She has that in common with her teen mother, Roxy, who also emits blackout energies, but for very different reasons. Roxy is a Void player, like Equius, so she is the human embodiment of a jamming signal, just like Equius is for Doc Scratch's omniscience. Rose is a Light player, but her blackout effects result from arguably the nadir of her role as such a hero—that is, when she succumbs to Scratch's manipulation and other eldritch persuasions, and goes grimdark. This truth would appear to lend credence to a line of classpect thinking known as \"inversion theory,\" which really isn't without its merits. This note has just gone to the bother of describing one of its merits, in fact. However, it is possible to get carried away with this line of thinking and use it to evaluate everything that happens in Homestuck. For instance, you could say, \"Well, Karkat is a Blood hero, and here's where he stops being as Karkatty as usual, so that means he's being the opposite of his aspect. Which means he's being Breathy instead of Bloody. So that means a bunch of other stuff, ipso facto, Homestuck has been EXPLAINED.\" That's not really the way all this works. Aspect lore runs deep, but it isn't the Rosetta Stone to the story. When in doubt, it's better to remember this: rather than an underlying mystical logic where all classpect roads lead to Deep Answers, HS is a comprehensive nexus of many themes, and all roads lead to the basic idea that this is a tale about kids who are trapped in the universal struggle associated with growing up."

          "content": "The two Space players are getting down to serious business finally. Maybe you've already deduced that this is primarily the point of these two talking to each other? If so, good job. I mentioned before that Space is a special aspect which is uniquely associated with procreation. They are the players who bring in the Forge, and as Kanaya explains here, they're also charged with \"breeding duties.\" That is, frog breeding, though it was definitely pretty amusing that Jade was briefly concerned it meant something else. Frogs, as we know, are the vessels for entire universes for some insane reason. But only if you successfully breed one in just the right way, and then deposit it into the center of Skaia where it can grow up to be huge and full of trillions of galaxies and stuff. But for now, this is aside the point. The fact that Space players are associated with procreation is something that is considerably more important to Kanaya's arc than to Jade's, since Kanaya is the one who has taken the responsibility of restoring her race by hatching the matriorb. It's a responsibility thrust on her culturally, as the only remaining jade blood, which is the caste associated with caring for the Mother Grub. But it's also a responsibility that Kanaya's putting on herself, out of real concern for the persistence of her kind. So, like many arcs where a character has one very specific thing they are Trying To Do, there are all these peaks and valleys in her quest to hatch this grub. Sometimes, such as here, suddenly there's hope! It was meant to be after all, and everything's going to be cool. Other times, there are massive setbacks, and everything seems completely fucked. (Another such bleak valley is coming up soon, featuring our least favorite sea-dwelling badboy.) Kanaya's story keeps going like this all the way to the end. Yeah, the orb is gonna hatch! Wait! No, it's not, everything is shit! Pretty standard arc turbulence, really. The key she randomly finds here is kind of an odd detail, and was possibly on my part just a facetious extension of the fact that in these RPG games, characters are constantly finding the most ludicrous shit in chests all over the place, which they themselves surely put in there to begin with. Who put this fuckin' key in here? Was it Gamzee? Let's say it was probably Gamzee. It's also an unusual nod to the fact that the trolls have sylladexes too. Really nutty ones that were shown in Hivebent and then quickly abandoned as irrelevant. Kanaya considers finding this key here as a sign of destiny. It means the orb is \"supposed\" to be freed for some greater purpose, and she's right. But not for the positive reasons she is currently assuming."

Maybe it seems preposterous out of context? No, actually, I just decided it doesn't at all, it's fine. If nothing else it gives Jade a handy way of flying, which in a story about building super tall houses, turns out to be an important perk. Everybody gets ways of flying, and they get increasingly casual in doing so, like this panel here making no big deal out of it. When John got a rocket pack it was treated like a big development, but everything after that was sort of hand-waved as \"oh yeah they can fly now btw.\" Dave got Unreal Air, Jade is Iron Man, and Rose can just plain fly because magic or whatever. Now that John is a god tier, he can just plain fly too.

Good luck with that.\" Maybe that would have been narratively sufficient. And yet, if not spelled out like this, many readers would probably have a BURNING NEED for the full writeup on Sburbian frog breeding. After all, it is sort of critical to the entire objective at the heart of the game. But it still has the feeling of a laborious side quest in a game. Like running around and gathering up chocobos in Final Fantasy VII or something. It kind of makes sense for that type of menial quest to lie at the center of Sburb, since the game seems to mostly revolve around aggravating busywork for the kids, partly as a test of resolve to determine if they've got the gumption to realize the busywork is useless bullshit, and hacking the system is almost always a smarter way to go about everything. We don't really get much deeper into the frog breeding challenge than this conversation here, and for a few moments in the future when we check in on Dave and Jade catching frogs.

If we got deeper into it, we'd probably see there's a lot more to this process than Kanaya is letting on. She says it's extremely time-consuming, but there are probably hacks to this quest just like most other things. The crux of the tedium is the fact that you can't just grab the paradox slime from any old frog. Only the ones you go mess with in the future, by catching them or some such. If you grabbed the slime from one, then didn't bother to go get it, then...perhaps you'd be entering a doomed timeline? There's some risk in addition to all the laborious scrambling around the planet with a frog-catching net. I think I could propose a pretty good hack, though. -->"

Grab them with nets, or even employ an army of consorts to help you round them up. Then you can take your thousands of frogs and trap them in a confined space, such as Jade's big, empty living room. Then you could grab the slime from every single frog in that room, knowing that you will easily be able to go \"hassle\" every frog in that confined space, only minutes later. In fact, the act of \"hassling\" them could simply take the form of releasing them back outside. Viola. You have easily harvested the slime of thousands of frogs en masse, resulting in a wide sampling of genetic material to make your huge god frog. I guess Kanaya didn't think of this? Listen, she has a lot of other stuff on her plate. So does Jade. Such as listening to Kanaya's suggestion that time travel would be one ill-advised way of hacking this problem, which of course means that Dave and Jade are definitely going to do it later."

If you step back for a moment, it sure seems like one of the more peculiar features of this entire mythos. Peculiar enough to ask what the hell was I thinking, to even have this idea? And WHY did I have it?! I don't know if I can answer the second question with any answer more satisfying than \"the original inspiration for it starts making a lot more sense once you see the tadpole swimming through Skaia, and the reproductive imagery that evokes.\" To the first question, I think there's more rationale to it than is immediately apparent, especially when you look at all the clues stacked up earlier in the story. For example, the heavy involvement with reptilian and amphibian life in the session via consorts and iconography, and the reptile and frog runes in the frog temple, which amount to a pictographic language encoding the universal propagation methodology, which is the Sburb program data. Essentially, my idea was for a new kind of cosmology that closely correlates with an entire ecology of fairly primitive life-forms. On the most fundamental layer of the ecology/cosmology, you have the horrorterrors, huge beasts we can't fathom and have no earthly basis for comparison (except Lovecraft's garbage, obviously). But the layer closer to the plane of existence we relate to is governed by an ecology of fauna we can also relate to better, which is an array of reptilian and amphibious creatures, with frogs being the most important. So important that they are the vessels for all physical reality we understand, and all other lifeforms on this order play a subordinate or auxiliary role in the cosmic makeup. I envisioned this thriving ecology even taking place inside a genesis frog. There aren't many clues in Homestuck that reveal this thinking, except the most glaring example, which is the cherubs. When you look at the role they play in a universe, and the fact that they're utterly microscopic compared to the frog they dwell within, they start seeming like extremely potent pathogens and antibodies in the frog's bloodstream. Nasty ones like Caliborn fly around attacking the \"cells\" (planets, stars), wreaking havoc, while good ones like Calliope fly around fighting them and defending the health of the system. Cherubs are not technically reptilian, but they aren't far off either. There aren't really any other examples like this appearing in the story, but I often pictured a whole range of cosmic life similar to this, all playing the same kinds of roles that microbes perform in our bodies."

It's hard to know for sure, other than giving us yet another indication that he's always got a lot of irons in the fire when it comes to manipulating the fate of these kids, and also that he's a creep who's inclined to get himself way too involved in the affairs of young girls. We already knew that stuff, though. At least we learn here that he was responsible for Kanaya's Prospitian awakening. But then Kanaya remarks with dramatic irony that Jade's lucky she didn't have anyone like this messing with her covertly, which of course we know to be false, since Vriska retconned herself into being the reason for practically everything, including Jade's sleeping habits. And Vriska herself was really just one of Doc's pet projects, as he insidiously pushed her to become what she is. This whole thing can be seen as Doc's pet project, right up until his death just after [S] Cascade. At which point his machinations cease to have any impact at all, which perhaps tellingly coincides with the end of Homestuck's identity as an meticulously over-engineered Nightmare Story.\n\nIt's important to give these new character match-ups something to bond over. There's practically always some material that can be used, because conveniently, due to the properties of \"persona alchemy\" as an iterative characterization method (which I've commented on in past books), there just happens to be a lot of character profile overlap. Kanaya is obviously the Jade of her group, in certain ways. Not in terms of personality, but definitely on a situational basis, like aspect, upbringing, etc. So why not let them jam a little on how cool it is that they had the same basic childhood, right down to living in clones of each other's houses? (Except, wait, I guess they don't mention that. But Jade would probably think that was REALLY COOL.) Then, a bit further, we see this is actually the \"Jade announces her password plan for the first time\" conversation, and Kanaya comes this close to blowing it and being the one responsible for the plan in the first place, by telling Jade that Future Jade already told her about it. I've talked about how often conversational material, ideas, plans, and such seem to eerily \"spontaneously generate\" themselves due to this clusterfuck of endlessly looping Trollian chat. Concepts and talking points which disturbingly have no origin at all. Maybe it's refreshing that one character finally has a problem with this. Jade just wants everyone to be the original author of their own thoughts and actions, and is applying some enforcement for this belief. Meanwhile, maybe it's odd that nobody else ever cared about this, or even really commented on it that much. They probably were all too distracted by the shouting matches, poor attempts at trolling, and emergent romantic quandaries. The fact that Jade takes a stand against letting Paradox Space write their own thoughts for them seems like a departure for her character. She spent her whole life cheerfully allowing her destiny to be dictated to her through cloud visions. Now that that's over, she's trying something different. Insisting on it, actually."

It was a good device to keep playing with, to try different things and serve different types of story purposes. And also people were intensely psyched about them every single time. They let the reader explore a bit and engage in some more frivolous conversations that probably wouldn't have made the cut in more conventional pages, thus making them \"fun.\" There are a few of these games in this book, all of them a little smaller than usual (as compared to the first Karkat RPG). But they are still monstrous consumers of book paper in totality, so I'm probably going to check out for a bit. There isn't much to be said on every single page here. Also, these books are fucking huge and it's kind of daunting to write notes for all this shit??? I need to find places to cut corners somewhere. JUST LET ME HAVE THIS. (Let's also consider this foreshadowing for the Act 6 books, where I find a lot more different excuses to omit notes from pages, to make that go faster. Like, oh look guys, Jake is visible again, which means it's time for me to boycott these pages with yet another brave exhibition of silent protest.)\n\nFeferi invites Kanaya to join her and Sollux in the horn pile. I don't really remember if this was the intent, but it sure seems like she's pitching Kanaya on getting involved in their quadrant situation in some way. Kanaya doesn't bite, though. (She does literally bite Feferi later, however, due to officially realizing she is a vampire.)\n\nSollux is being dense. His fish girlfriend was just trying to open the relationship up a bit. Maybe Kanaya could be pale for Fef but spades for Sollux? Or, given the snippy exchange here, maybe Sollux and Feferi could vacillate to black, while Feferi works the red angle with Kanaya? These fools just don't stay open to the POSSIBILITIES. Clearly Eridan is the only one here with any fucking sense.\n\nThe top left panel has the best line in the game. You can just skip to the end now.\n\nA lot of this game seems dedicated to establishing an ominous atmosphere to build up to the Murderstuck zone, which we don't even know is going to happen yet, but you actually do because I'm telling you, and you probably already read it anyway. Everyone's missing. We know one person has died but they think he's still alive (Tavros). One person is still alive but they think she died (Aradia). Everyone else is lurking somewhere in the meteor, conspicuously absent by some of the stuff they left behind. It's making Kanaya and Karkat nervous. It's making us nervous.\n\nEridan says he has to \"help Kanaya out with this thing\" but doesn't actually say what he means by that. There are a bunch of little ambiguities like this leading up to what happens next, disguising his sinister intent. Or maybe hinting at it, if you have keen senses. We are merely pages away from Eridan fully embracing his role as the incel murderboy he was always meant to be.\n\nKayana: Splash Faygo in his face, grab the orb like a fumbled football, and sprint for a touchdown. Let's see if she listens to me on the next page...\n\nShe doesn't. :(\n\nAt this point Eridan might as well be wearing a T-shirt that says in big violet letters \"I AM LITERALLY ABOUT TO KILL YOU.\"\n\nWait, I'm back, to say something important. Just joking, actually. There's still not much to say about all this. It's just some bad love triangle melodrama playing itself out, while sort of harmlessly tucked away in this \"one page\" playable panel. There were some pretty funny lines over the last dozen pages or so, at least. Do you really need me to point out when things are funny? Sigh, yes. You do. Of course you do.\n\nEridan seems to have two gears, \"huge martyr\" and \"wrathfully incredulous.\" He's incredulous about a lot of things, like \"How dare you accuse me of (something I obviously did).\" He's incredulous the kitty cat shipper girl wouldn't succumb to his advances after he saved her life. He just can't believe what a raw deal he's always getting and how little respect he's given. Which then fuels his feeling of martyrdom. But this is what makes him one of our problematic faves. This is all pretty great, actually, and is essentially why you start cheering on bad characters to keep doing their bad shit. I hope he kills somebody soon!\n\nThe upper right panel has one of the more Eridancore lines he ever says, with an honorable mention to the use of the word \"poppycock.\" Come to think of it, his vocabulary has shades of Jake in it, who also happens to be a Hope player. Yikes, Eridan just took another big step backwards in terms of dignity. Guy really can't catch a break.\n\nThe plot of the latter phase of Act 5 mostly seems to revolve around a bunch of different plans to address the Jack situation, and every single one of them is pretty bad. But this one is especially terrible and pathetic. In fact, it's hard to even really describe it as a plan. Someone really should cut Eridan in half with a chainsaw before he tries this.\n\nI believe these sprites were adapted from the style of a Scott Pilgrim game. Same as the one where Vriska stole luck from the big chess monster. Why? I really don't know. Just another style tossed into the ever-expanding portfolio of styles in Homestuck. These were made very casually by one of the art contributors, so there weren't really a ton of sprite frames to use, which meant that the battle couldn't be that extensive. Not that I wanted to make an extensive battle anyway, because wow, what a waste of time. So this does what a lot of these Flash action scenes do, which is take things right up to the edge of conflict, then move on with some standard panel action.\n\nThat E=mc² graphic background is to help visually indicate that Eridan is not using magic here, but SCIENCE. Pretty smart, huh? Like, Einstein-level smart, probably. If he could be here today and look at this page, he'd be like, \"Damn dude, I officially give the fuck up on being a genius, because I'll never beat that.\""

He never gets quite as nakedly malevolent as this, but many of his behaviors (performative suicides, intellectual aggression/pretension, self-martyring rhetoric) put him in the same category as Eridan in terms of potential for villainy in their profiles. Maybe this is something Princes have in common? We also know (well, much later on we know) that the Prince is a very dangerous destroyer class.

The Emotional Climax is...[S] Terezi: Remem8er, maybe? A lot of this is up for dispute and personal interpretation. The Meta-Bullshit Climax was the end result of John's retcon arc.

Finally, here comes \"Sober Gamzee,\" the shitty murderclown he was always destined to become but nobody thought he would for some reason. What is there to say about him? I dunno. Probably lots of stuff, and much of it already said in previous books wherein I could not find the discipline to keep my shit under control and wait until his metamorphosis actually happened before discussing it. That's fine though, because it just means I have opportunities to repeat myself ad nauseum, thereby gradually indoctrinating you into thinking way too much about Homestuck, which you likely already do anyway. The first thing jumping out at us here, which tells you something is off about Gamzee right away, is that his typing quirk has changed. Why? Good question, why don't we talk about it. Gamzee alternates capitalizing and lowercasing between entire sentences now, rather than every other letter. Originally, his standard quirk was meant to signify a whimsical—capricious, if you will—typing and speaking style. He's up, he's down, he's up, he's down...like an unpleasant rollercoaster ride at a carnival. But because the alternation was so tight, on the individual letter level, it had a way of diffusing his capricious qualities and averaging them out more broadly across his statements and his personality in general. In a sense, it signified a neutralization of his volatile tendencies. It's like lying on a bed of nails: the more tightly packed the nails are, the less dangerous it is. You may forget the bed even consists of dangerous components. But if you start separating them out, the deadliness becomes more evident. Isolating the capital letters into their own lines is like consolidating all the nails into one lethal, sharp object, like a knife, and then intermittently wielding it to stab you in one line, then sheathing it the next. So it would seem Gamzee's psychological break, whether brought on by \"sobriety\" or other factors, had a way of sharpening the divide in his mind between his murderous and benign tendencies, whereas in his previous state they all blended together into a vaguely addled, mostly harmless personality. He expresses some understanding of this divide here, by identifying himself as the two messiahs he always worshipped. Also, even though the divide in his personality has crystalized, and he understands this, it seems his murderous persona heavily predominates when he is in this state of mind. It is the more powerful and aggressive version of his personality, which can easily steamroll his chill stoner attitude once it's loose. It should be noted that a personality which is bifurcated between good and evil, and the predomination of one over the other, is a critical feature of the cherubs appearing later, who arguably are a much better fit for his mirthful messiah prophecy."

Actually, even the trolls didn't suspect it while knowing his aspect, since Karkat says here they all thought Bard of Rage was a joke title. To help us all freak out about this a little more, Karkat \"reminds\" us of how deadly Gamzee can be by citing his crazy, out-of-the-blue attack against the Black King. In doing so he provides some interesting color about how that battle went, which doesn't serve much purpose except to feed your headcanons somewhat on that event, as well as send the message \"Gamzee is actually really strong under the right circumstances, and oh, also Vriska is too FYI, but you probably already knew that.\" Then Stoned Gamzee pops into the conversation like an idiot, and Karkat basically treats him like a completely different person than the one who did the murders.

If this were a doomed timeline, that would mean it's possible the right thing to do would be to try to alter the past via Trollian and set things back onto the rails of the alpha timeline, which is basically what happened with Davesprite. He, a strict product of a doomed timeline, is instrumental in the course correction which the alpha timeline needed to continue. Okay, I'm probably starting to slightly confuse myself, whilst massively confusing you. The bottom line is, even if Karkat did think \"This is a doomed timeline, and I need to fix it,\" it still wouldn't have worked, because this isn't a doomed timeline. It's the alpha timeline, and everyone dying here is just normal-doomed, not doomed-doomed. There's a clear distinction between those things. If you're doomed-doomed, it means you're living in a non-viable timeline, which is running its course and tapering off into oblivion, sort of as a means of Paradox Space keeping itself tidy. But if you're just normal-doomed, it means your death was an important event in the long chain of authoritative actions which were all necessary to keep reality itself propped up. So does that mean it's better to be normal-doomed than doomed-doomed? I'm not sure. I guess you could ask some ghosts about it. Though chances are, the normal ghosts don't feel substantially more honored than the doomed ghosts for having died a relevant death. Mostly they stop caring about any mortality issues at all, and get back on their bullshit as soon as possible upon entering the dream bubbles.\n\nHere comes the Great Artsplainer again to brazenly point out to you when things are good or funny. This is a very funny conversation. We're now lodged firmly in the black craw of Murderstuck, which means we're messing with the horror genre. Things are scary and sad, and seemed especially so when this was all being posted slowly, which helped cultivate a dreadful atmosphere. But the fact that Homestuck operates in the comedy genre almost always supersedes all other sub-genre considerations, so you get funny stuff like this while people are dying. Also you get Feferi's corpse flopping back onto piles of horns, and tactless memes posted along with Kanaya's tragic death. Looking back on this, especially with the option of being able to read it swiftly, almost all of this content strikes me as having higher humor properties than scary or sad properties. Shit's just very, very funny Literally All The God Damned Time, and I've always wondered a little about the people who don't view the story that way. Why...wh...what...are you doing here? How can you continue subjecting yourself to this experience in good conscience? Oh well, thank you sincerely for your apparent willingness to hang on to every single word of my auto-analysis despite your very strange opinions I guess?\n\nGamzee from 42:00 minutes (blaze it) hops back into the chat and says he's about to do some more murders, letting us survey the near-term temporal landscape again. That means over the next 42 minutes, he probably doesn't kill anyone yet, but he's gearing up to. It's also just another horror beat, but with a temporal twist. The villain sometimes will check in with the hero in a threatening way like this, to let them know they're watching and have them boxed into a corner in some way. But in this case, Gamzee has Karkat \"surrounded\" in time, not just space. He's in the future, so he knows what Karkat is going to do and where he's going to be."

You know, in case you forgot some of those scenes with Dave from the beginning of this book already. Regardless, she does have a strong sense of conscience and a passion for justice, lest you forget her defining qualities as a character. You are one forgetful person, aren't you. That's okay, that's why I'm here (unless I forget shit too, in which case we're all boned). So even though she's upset about this, her instincts for justice kick in right away and override all other sentiments. An investigation must begin. And yes, she is definitely BAD at investigating crimes, let's not kid ourselves here. But in the true spirit of her legislacerator forebears, the act of discovering the truth of a crime is immeasurably dwarfed by the need to enforce harsh retribution against anyone who probably committed a crime. So at least for now, Terezi is using her justice fixation as a strong intellectual diversion from having to confront any more raw emotions, which she's all tapped out on after that series of grimly philosophical Strider fiascos. Perhaps this makes us think it isn't the first time this hobby has served as such an outlet. Then again, it could be that she's giving Tavros a little too much credit for his ability to make her cry under any circumstances. Hard to imagine wasting any tears on the guy, even at an onion-chopping competition."

This is basically another way of saying what is described above. You start with a premise. Like, that Lemonsnout guy ALMOST CERTAINLY did it. Why, you ask? Well, just LOOK at him. Looook at the filthy scoundrel. Are you looking? He's utterly disgusting. Greedy, venal, the epitome of corruption in government. Look how much he LUSTS for beetles. You can see the gluttony written all over his face. Yes, maybe this is not good legal practice by the standards of a liberal democracy. But you have to admit that now and then the premature insistence of a culprit's guilt is going to coincide with the fact that the target in question actually IS guilty.

But she has a greater degree of perspicacity in other ways, through her Mind aspect, her cleverness and insight into others, and so on. But she also has certain \"blind spots,\" not unlike Doc does. Some blind spots are similar to everyone else's, like navigating stupid romantic issues with troublesome boys like Karkat. But probably her biggest blind spot is localized on Gamzee himself. Here she worries for his safety, in a fit of vintage Murderstuck dramatic irony. But it's more than just a gag. She just can't seem to lock on to him as a source of trouble, negativity, or outright evil. She gives him the benefit of the doubt, overlooks the red flags, and keeps him in her life long beyond the moment when she should have cut him loose. This acute case of Clown Blindness seems to be the entire foundation of the Gamrezi debacle. It's not until the retcon stunt—which she designs in part to break some negative patterns in her life—that she finally lifts the clown curse.

Oh yeah, that's right, I can hear you saying. That totally checks out. But why bring back that particular motif at that particular moment? Man, you are full of questions today. I think it helps signal that what she's doing at that moment is still directly tied to her longterm arc's association with the pursuit of justice.

Come to think of it, she may not even have been all that mad when Vriska paralyzed him either. It was Aradia's death that made her want to get revenge. Actually, the more you look at the facts, the more it seems like Terezi's just looking for any excuse to pursue investigative/vengeful justice against Vriska, and the injury or death of her friends always just happens to be a decent cover story."

That's a good thing for us though, because this scene is legendary. Here I am, dressed as a Man-Skylark, which isn't actually a thing at all on any plane of reality. But it sort of fits here, because I'm essentially reprising the role Robin Williams played in Hook. Williams played a fully grown Peter Pan who forgot he was Peter Pan and had to go back to Never Never Land to rescue his kids. I, too, am a grown man awkwardly shoved into a story for kids, fumbling around like a stooge and falling in love with Rufio.

There are 32,000 ounces in a ton. That means there are 2,909 cans in a ton. The base of the can stack is 14x14 cans, which is 196. It's hard to count how high the stack is from the panels a couple pages ago, but I'm counting 9 cans high under the top cut. So it wouldn't be unreasonable to suspect it's a 14x14x14 stack, which adds up to 2,744. But if you guess it's 15 cans high instead of 14, that brings the total up to 2,940. It sounds much more likely that I went with a 15-can high stack, to clear the minimum 2,909 threshold for one ton, which Dad would surely want to exceed by at least a little bit, for safety reasons. This is pretty compelling evidence that I did in fact go to the rigors of calculating all this originally. It's possible the only thing more pedantic than calculating how many cans of shaving cream are needed to make a one-ton block for the sake of your silly comic, is to go to the bother of reverse engineering those calculations eight years later to prove to yourself and everyone else that's exactly what you did."

God forbid we forget to track the tropes. There are too many to name exhaustively. That's why TV Tropes pages generally consist of an infinity of unreadable garbage. But here are a few. Horror films isolate the heroes. Check. The trolls are trapped on a meteor, and if they venture out, they get killed by an even deadlier threat, Jack. They've been separated. Divide and conquer is a pretty standard horror villain strategy. The threat has been demonstrated by offing some \"lesser\" characters. (Feferi, Tavros, and Sollux are KO'd.) Kanaya turning out not to be dead, in a surprise \"She's alive?!\" twist later, is also a horror trope. There are still surviving characters for us to worry about and for our heroes to worry about as well and \"protect.\" Which is to say, if you wish to bring gendered ideas into focus, there are damsels about. Karkat is worried about Terezi on the previous page, so she's a sort of damsel to track (which is about how he views her in general as a knightboy, hence some of the issues that plague their relationship in general, but let's not get sidetracked by Karezi nonsense here). Whereas she, who (correctly) has deduced Vriska's murderous nature, is now (incorrectly) concerned for Gamzee's well-being, which makes Gamzee one of her damsels to track, unfortunately (which is probably also a referendum on their bad future relationship). There's a lot going on here when we begin studiously cracking the tropes. Murderstuck easily contains the plot of an entire horror film."

          "content": "Here's [S] Equius: Seek the highbl00d, another playable RPG game. This was a really good one. They all kind of are, in their own ways. Except for the Meenahbound ones, which are Arguably Bad, Actually, but I only agree to that assessment if it includes the ever important \"bad in mostly good and funny ways\" stipulation upon which the structural stability of my entire creative career rests. But Christ, why am I talking about that garbage when we are about to review some truly choice material focusing exclusively on your favorite meowrails. It is a great illustration of their tragic dynamic; deeply committed and caring partners in the diamonds quadrant, and yet compromised by Equius and his stubborn class-driven faults, his pathological reverence for his superiors, his forced and probably not genuinely felt sense of disdain for lower bloods like Nepeta, and ultimately his failure to rise above these flaws when presented with a real test of character and friendship. A test imposed, of course, by a boorish murderclown, who from this point onward just ruins fucking everything, constantly. Also there's great horror ambience in this game, with a real sense of tension. It's one of these unusual installments where I will bother to say: you just need to play this one to really feel it. If you haven't already, well..that kind of baffles me? But I guess I just don't know anything about anybody reading these books, especially as we trudge relentlessly into the future. Maybe you're reading this ancient tome printed 500 years ago, and the online content doesn't exist anymore. If that's the case, I'm so, so sorry, Robosteve8937501.\n\nAnd, now that I just talked up this great game, here's where I check out for a while again, because obviously I'm not going to wisecrack my way through every single page of this thing, because, um...l have a LIFE??? Maybe you should look into that. Yeah, I'm looking at YOU, Robosteve8937501. Have you set foot outside your consumption pod even ONCE over the last couple centuries? This is getting pathetic, man.\n\nI know what you're thinking. You're thinking Robosteve8937501 is going to turn into another one of my running joke characters down here in the author notes realm, which includes an entirely distinct continuum for casually idiotic worldbuilding, and against all odds and better judgment, you're actually becoming inexplicably invested in it. It's okay, you can admit it. You love the weird stories about my dead youth pastor, priest, and life coach from previous books, and now you're looking forward to future mentions of Robosteve8937501 as well, which is becoming additionally inevitable now that I've talked about him this much already. What do those numbers Is that his phone number? The answer is yes. Robosteve8937501 is actually very lonely, and he wants you to call him. Dude can't get a date to save his mean? Is that... life. Probably because he spends so much time holed up in his fucking consumption pod, reading and rereading all 200 volumes of the Homestuck books, 500 years after they were printed, and about 490 years after the apocalypse that wiped out the human race.\n\nThat's the end of all the dialogue between these two in this game. Every line was extremely good. Nothing I could say down here would improve upon it even a little, nor would any further analysis increase your pure enjoyment or appreciation of the content. Wow, I think I just found the perfect author note to paste at the bottom of every page from now on.\n\nThen Nepeta embarks on her quest to \"hide,\" i.e. find a place to watch Equius get killed, then jump out and get killed herself. We don't know that's what's going to happen yet, but I think this game lays it on pretty thick with the clues that something bad is going to happen. Their drawn-out goodbye, the emotional conversation they just had that spotlight them as characters, and which often precedes characters dying in media as a way of letting the viewers say their farewells too, and also the obvious fact that we're in the horror zone, so we might as well strap ourselves in and expect characters to start dropping like flies. Perhaps this game in serving all these purposes starts feeling additionally cruel, because if you didn't care much about these characters before reading all that stuff, you probably do now. Just in time to say goodbye. Let that be a lesson. Appreciate good characters while you still have the chance, and don't be late to hop on the bandwagon. Because by the time you hop on, the bandwagon may have been rigged to be just about to kill your newfound faves in a variation of the trolley experiment.\n\nThere are teapots all over the place. If nothing else, Nepeta's land has given her a lifelong passion for tea. Too bad her post-tea life didn't last very long. But it's also worth noting how it nicely pairs with Equius's milk habits. Maybe they could set up a nice tea shop in the afterlife. In fact, who's to say they didn't?\n\nNepeta's private space in the meteor involves—you guessed it—more shipping. All the depictions here and on following pages show pairings that seem to have a logical basis in the story. Except for the Dave x Tavros match-up. Accuse me of \"ship hate\" if you will, but that is an absolutely shameful pairing decision. Nepeta deserves to receive crushing volumes of anonymous internet harassment for this pitiful display of bad taste. Quick, everyone go submit your displeasure to user account \"@arsenicCatnip\" before she dies.\n\nThe \"great\" label is just a SBaHJ-ism. Jeff bumped up against the \"great\" to spy on Bro doing something stupid, if I recall correctly. We are just reprising that scenario, as Nepeta employs the same spying technique on Gamzee as he murders Equius. It's BASICALLY the exact same situation.\n\nNepeta's secret shame is exposed. There's nothing that shameful about her crush, because come on. We all love Karkat. I don't know who she was hiding it from though? Equius, at most? But what are moirails for if she can't share her secret flushed leanings with her partner? What have they even been talking about for hours on the smashed robot pile?? Also she didn't do a very good job covering up her HUGE mural with those crates. It's almost as if she wants her secret to be exposed. Nepeta...you're a fucking mess.\n\nThis is where the game gets especially creepy, mainly because of the music shift. My chief recollection of the music is that every now and then, an eerie distant honking sound can be heard. This is when you began to suspect Nepeta is completely screwed.\n\nTouches like this help fill in the blanks of a story with subtext. Brown blood is everywhere. That means Tavros's body is being moved around, probably by Gamzee, given the text on the wall. What is he doing with that body??? (He is severing the head, so that he may passionately kiss it on the mouth at his leisure.)\n\nMore signs that Kanaya is on the move as well. She even sliced the transporter behind her so she couldn't be followed. She might be the only one who isn't being an idiot right now. But to be fair, that might also be a good description of her in relation to all twelve trolls over the general span of the entire story. What did she ever do that's dumb? I'm trying to think of something. Oh wait, I got it. She fell in love with Vriska. Wait. Wait...no. I lost it again. That was the smartest thing she ever did, because Vriska kicks ass and did nothing wrong.\n\nWhy is this fuckin wizard in this chest? I don't even... I mean, I do know the answer. It's because one of the supporting artists made a wizard sprite, completely unprompted, as they did with almost all the items in these games. But still. Kinda makes you think? (Nah.)\n\nNepeta sees something horrible through the vent. It's a great time to cut away to Equius so we can catch up with what she is seeing from his point of view. Which is great for him, since he has a front-row seat for what's currently happening here.\n\nBack to Equius. He sends Nepeta off for her own \"safety\" and...immediately begins using his powerful hands to shatter his many glasses of milk that are scattered about on the floor for some reason. Good work, dude.\n\nThis chess monster can't catch a break. First, Vriska stole all its luck, sending it crashing down into this pit. Then Gamzee, with inexplicably incredible marksmanship, fires an arrow double-shot into both eyes, killing it. Come to think of it, the fact that Vriska drained all its luck shortly before probably had something to do with its unlikely arrow-based slaying as well.\n\nSo that's where Terezi's glasses went. Gamzee stealing a personal item of hers seems like a loaded action. As if he's signaling to her that he isn't quite done with her yet. I wonder what that means? I hope it's not creepy and awful. Equius, like a complete idiot, thinks that's Terezi up there on the big mad-science tank. Cue the murderclown's diabolical monologue. This Flash sequence was embedded in the RPG game as a strong finish to the interactive page. You kind of knew it would end up this way. Actually, many of the games are played with a sense of dark dramatic irony where you know something bad is going to happen, but you're forced to march right along to that outcome anyway, so you are somewhat complicit in the unfortunate result. The Rose RPG at the end of this book is probably the best example of this.\n\nGamzee's negligent goatfather was killed before he entered the game, and was prototyped, as were all the trolls' lusii. This means goat-like forms show up in the chess monsters. Gamzee is sitting atop the tank of one such mutant beast, which almost entirely bears the traits of his aquatic goatfather. Is it a coincidence he has gravitated toward this figure while being his truest, most evil, clowny self? In some ways, due to parental neglect, his goat dad embodies his darkest tendencies, and perhaps the root causes for them. Yes, maybe this isn't \"true\" and he's just a piece of total trash regardless, but it's arguably true from Gamzee's warped perspective. In some ways this makes Goat Dad a compelling figure. We know almost nothing about him, but he quite possibly was legitimately monstrous. I'm fascinated by this fictional goat creature suddenly. Whoops, wait. It stopped. I'm not fascinated anymore. But it was an interesting feeling to have for about three seconds.\n\nAll the dialogue leading up to this is pretty good. It lets us know that Gamzee didn't just generically \"snap\" and is now an arbitrary murderous threat. There are some real cunning and calculation to his evil. Despite previously coming across as a bit dumb, and tone-deaf to the needs and concerns of his friends, his remarks here reveal a guy who was paying close attention all along and knows all these people quite well. He knows the insecurities and weaknesses to play to. He's just tormenting Equius using the fact that he knows he's all twisted up about class hierarchy, demanding that he kneel before his superior. But not in a way that makes it clear he will appreciate Equius's subservience, or reward him for it. Gamzee just wants to disgrace and defile Equius before he kills him, to make him reveal the full extent of his weakness as his final living act. To show Equius couldn't overcome his limitations even to save his own life, let alone the lives of his friends.\n\nBut later, the kind of sadistic cunning Gamzee shows here sort of gives way to a different kind of villainy. After he \"makes peace\" with his role as a figure of \"religious destiny,\" that is, the guy meant to serve Lord English and help seed his early existence as Caliborn, he mellows out a little. There's a kind of sick, off-putting serenity he broadcasts as he commits his unpleasant deeds, behaving as more of a general agent of chaos rather than an active antagonist. He seems to delight more in wreaking havoc on the story as a whimsical surrogate for his master than he does in specifically causing his former friends to suffer. In other words, he gradually becomes folded into the greater villainous ensemble, which becomes increasingly preposterous the deeper we get into Homestuck."

This is also a reprisal of the ridiculous \"HERO MODE\" panel from a while ago, which was designed to mildly sass some guys who kept wanting Gamzee to be rendered in hero mode for some reason. The panel format's echo here similarly is, I guess, designed to sass anyone who might be inclined to take the tragic death of their beloved favorite characters the slightest bit seriously. That's part of what Gamzee does. He causes horrible things to happen, and his very presence and the way he's shown often reads as an irreverent jab toward those who think the emotions surrounding the tragic nature of what's going on should be taken more seriously. It's part of his villainous assault on the story, actually. It's not just causing bad things to happen, but including an element of all-around degradation of the events in question. It's as if a murderer showed up to his victim's funeral and just started pissing everywhere, splatting pies in his face while honking his horn, and falling down a lot.

But the point is, I think the gist of what I was saying about this back then was that Equius could have stopped this from happening any time, which IIRC, seemed to be a controversial statement. I think some people at the time might have been a little raw about their sweet strongboy getting offed in such a pointless, humiliating, and non-heroic manner. Fair??? Sure. Not only could he have clocked this jackoff clown into outer space any time he wanted, he didn't even necessarily need to die of asphyxiation. It's just a piece of string, and his neck muscles are extremely powerful. He could have flexed hard and snapped the string. The real problem isn't his lack of strength or heroism, it's his pathological subservience, and perhaps even more troubling, a certain enjoyment of what is taking place here. Maybe people who loved Equius just didn't want to have to face the truth about him, which is that when the chips are down, he's actually just a loser who can't overcome his most base urges, his racism, his fetishism, his deep craving for ludicrous situations of domination. People want their favorites to rise up, to overcome, to flourish. Still, I would posit that even if you're an Equius fan, you're still not as big a fan of him as I am, which is a fact I'm prepared to defend with my fists if need be. And I say this was a fitting end to his role in the story. (That is, until he comes back in various forms and keeps doing a lot of insanely great shit). You see, unlike you, I adored him enough to stay true to his nature, even at the cost of his life. He died doing what he loved: getting strangled by a clowny superior until he was b100 in the face. Or maybe I should say, he died doing what I love: participating in the death of a beloved OC under preposterous and degrading circumstances in order to own everybody so hard, even their grandchildren feel owned."

I can't even read this shit. It's like trying to focus on a pack of zebras. Can someone tell me what they're saying? ANYONE??? Hang on, I'm getting a text from 500 years in the future. Oh, it's Robosteve8937501. You see? I TOLD you this guy would become a recurring character in the author notes canonspace. He says Vriska is just offering an incredibly lame apologist defense of her murder, because something something cultural differences, and also Tavros was reeeeeeeeally annoying, so she just haaaaaaaad to do it. Hmm. You know what? I don't think I like this guy's fucking tone. Sounds to me like he's harshing on our number-one girl. Well listen up, fucko. You don't get to do that down here. Not in THIS chuckle basement you don't. I'm going to block Robosteve8937501's number. Which will be easy, since it's contained right there in his name.\n\nAnd then Vriska just keeps on going, revealing that it was her very first murder... Wait, except for all those other murders she did to feed her spider mom. But she didn't like those people! And her shitty spider mom was hungry. And yes, it may have been an absolutely genocidal number of murders, BUT. Look how sad she looks in that panel. D'aw, don't be like that Vriska. All is forgiven. Wait, what's that? There was a second friendmurder you forgot about? Aradia? Hmm, that one keeps slipping your mind, doesn't it. Well, that doesn't sound great, but we already just offered blanket amnesty for every bad thing you've ever done, because we can't bear to see you this sad. So that confession doesn't really count against you. Any more murders you'd like to confess? Because those are all fine too. Wait, maybe don't tell us about any more, so it doesn't make us feel any weirder about this. Just joking, you can tell us. You can do whatever you want. We're gonna allow that, because that's what it means to forgive someone who looks as truly sorry as you do right now."

There's a whole other dimension of self indulgence we're seeing from her, switching gears from \"Here's why my literal thousands of murders shouldn't be held against me,\" to \"It sure is a shame we never got to grow up, but [lip trembles a bit]...it was awfully nice we got to make all your stars for you along the way.\" I think this marks the moment when we start seeing Vriska's full capacity as a Light player blabbermouth. Which is a concept we don't really begin to have a full appreciation for until we start reading Mindfang's horseshit (coming very soon, I'm pleased to report), and much later, Aranea's even horsier shit. Then we connect that to Rose's tendencies and suddenly it all starts to make sense. It is my view that such indulgently prolix characters start seeming a lot more endearing and less burdensome when you know that character trait is actually a cosmic feature stemming from a mystically endowed core to their identity. In a way, it almost starts to come across as a very specific type of disability. See? Just another reason to root for Vriska. She's doing her best despite her impairment of self-obsession.\n\nAt the end of the day, Vriska did 90% of the talking, while John intermittently offered a few remarks such as \"wow\" and \"geez\" and \"huh\" and \"golly, that's a lot of murders...\" But then, that's why John is such a perfect friend. And an even perfecter friend for Vriska, who really just wants a boy-foil functioning as the ultimate enabler and sounding board for her apologist \"multicultural\" navel gazing and self-absorbed rationalization narratives. He is the Heir of Breath after all. It's a passive class, and he's a passive guy. An heir, literally speaking, is one who inherits stuff. Let's infer this to mean, for the sake of this particular note, someone who \"inherits\" by making room for something to fill, such as wind. He certainly provides that service for a whole lot of hot air when it comes to Vriska."

Wow, a BOLD CLAIM, if that's what you think, and can I just say, how dare you? Now that our grievances have been formally registered with each other, I will just insist that actually the origin of this story element came about in a pretty organic way. There's a very logical paper trail to the thought process, which went something like this. We saw that Sburb through its predestination mechanics supplied Earth with our four kid heroes and their parents, all at once. That established a convention for how the game seeds a planet with its own players and guardians. Next, we focus on a new race of kids, which played the exact same game as tailored to their species. It follows the same conventions we know of, but we also learned trolls are very different, and don't have parents or guardians in the same way humans do. Monsters raise them. So if the same pattern holds, where Sgrub creates its own heroes as well as twelve genetically similar alt-trolls to send even further back in time to live as adults, then how does that actually work? What societal structure can this idea fit into, if the trolls don't have parents or families? In other words, we need some cultural conventions that allow for adult trolls to have some kind of relevant relation to kid trolls in a way that's compatible with all of the societal constructs that have already been established. Not only do the trolls not have parents, there aren't even any adults on their planet, and there haven't been for centuries. So if any alt-trolls were sent back by Sgrub to live as adults, they would have to be sent back hundreds of years ago, which already begins to frame their relation to the players as necessarily ancestral rather than parental. And if these people are actually going to have any relevance to the kids, that means their culture needs to place some sort of fundamental importance on the idea of having ancestors, in a way that is compatible with their a-familial procreation system. It's more about being linked to certain figures of historical legend who share a lot of traits with you (like sign, caste, and genetic similarities) than it is about directly traceable lineage like it is for humans. Vriska basically spells it all out here. In other words, this isn't a rabbit getting pulled out of a hat, it's an answer to some questions that were implicitly being asked by the story, and the answer was already kind of boxed in by a lot of pre-established lore. This is pretty much how worldbuilding in general works. You build a world, then the world keeps seeming to ask these implicit questions, and many of the answers are shaped and confined by the facts already spread out on the table. This process leads to results which are: interesting! Arguably more interesting than if you just pulled some ideas like this out of thin air. These ideas arose naturally and logically from a continuously emergent framework, which makes it all feel more sturdy, and perhaps explains why this facet of the story was very successful in capturing people's imaginations."

          "content": "You have to just accept some things I tell you as fact before other stuff I say means anything. You have to accept it as a fundamental truth that people absolutely lost their shit for these ancestors. There were some potent feelings surrounding them, and probably still are. They fueled a lot of speculation and wild headcanoning. Which just contributed to their magnification in the story, taking us deeper through the extraneous worldbuilding looking glass, until we ended up with an in-depth look at all twelve dancestors, which was an entirely uncharted endeavor into some brand-new, transcendentally indulgent territories. But forget about those losers for a second. Where dancestors were shit, ancestors arguably remain lit, so let's not kill this buzz just yet. What is it about this vague shot of a grinning pirate woman that makes you go nuts for this implied lore? I think its ambiguous qualities are actually central to its appeal. Applying limitation and constraint to certain elements often is what galvanizes those elements as standout material. Like, yes, I could have rendered her in great detail, in full color, and dumped a lot more info about her all up front, but that would compromise the aura of intrigue surrounding this character and all ancestral lore associated with her. It deprives you of a mystery to solve, or a canvas on which to project your imagination. This way, you're gradually pulled deeper into the mystery by reading first-hand accounts of her life, which involve many oblique references that just invite more questions. I think worldbuilding, and much of storytelling in general, involves grappling with issues of excess vs. limitation. It's a binary that can be explored, and freely swinging between them can be revealing. There are a lot of theoretical binaries like this, such as meat vs. candy, which I mentioned a book or two ago. But unlike the meat/candy binary, excess vs. limitation isn't just some shit I made up using allegorical symbology which nobody understands and will require approximately one hundred books to explain. This is an idea probably most people understand on some level.\n\nHomestuck as a whole probably reads as a massive exercise on the \"excess\" end of the spectrum. Because...there's a lot of it? Obviously. It sprawls due to its whimsical, freeform construction, which is just the nature of the beast it grew up to be. Thinking in terms of \"bad\" or \"good\" can be pretty uninformative when applied to either end of these media-evaluation binaries. There are pros and cons to everything, various trade-offs and factors to balance. With storytelling excess, the cons are: things can get kind of sloggy and unfocused, or develop other problems of that nature. The upsides are: engendering a sense of hugeness, a story expanse that feels more \"lived in\" the more you read, and more material to obsess over and analyze—all the things that many avid consumers of media are known to prize. You trade some good properties (the strengths of limitation) for other good properties (the boons of excess). But if you zoom in closer on HS, you see the greater excess is cobbled together by many smaller bits and pieces, like arcs, vignettes, sub-genre writeups, and intriguing little forays into these distinct worldbuilding endeavors. And I think these smaller building blocks often do exhibit the stronger properties that arise from emphasis on \"limitation\" in storytelling. Which is why this stint with ancestral lore we're about to go on, while in a broader sense contributes to the bloat of HS and adds to its overall profile of \"excess,\" at the local level I think uses the tactics of restraint and limitation effectively enough to make it something fascinating to think about. Which then begins tilting the argument in favor of its inclusion in the first place. This pattern appears to hold true for many such excessive-seeming inclusions, like the entire god tier system involving classes and aspects. It constitutes a massive overall inflation of the story's lore footprint, but its presentation holds back, I think, just enough information to make it intriguing and worth theorizing about. If it told you everything, there'd be nothing to wonder about. But if it told you too little, you might not care enough to wonder at all."

They become a happier, more relieved, easier-going version of themselves. When Aradia ditches a defining quality we came to know her by (being dead), she becomes a much happier and self-actualized Aradia. Sollux also seems to be chilling out now that his defining properties (bifurcation, etc.) have been KO'd. He had a mouth full of gnarly teeth that gave him a wicked lisp (gone), eyes full of nasty laser beams (gone, along with his eyesight), and a brain full of doomsday visions and bipolar disorder (also gone—well, maybe not the bipolar thing, because that's probably not how that works, but whatever). You get more of this kind of thing in even higher degrees with some of the fusion stuff that happens later (Arquius, Davepeta), where characters become almost euphoric versions of themselves for having been completely liberated from certain self-limitations which previously defined them. The concept of an \"ultimate self,\" which appears much later, probably has its roots way back to stuff like this, which got the ball rolling on the idea that a more complete or fulfilled self is one that becomes free from mortal limitations, or the idiosyncrasies which comprise a specific instance of one version of yourself. Hence an ultimate self is an aggregate of someone's full potential. It's not just doing away with negative traits, but summing up all iterations of yourself, including ones without those traits, allowing you to move beyond them. Or maybe more accurately, to view them as insignificant in the grand totality of what a person really is."

I think that's primarily what it means for Aradia to play the role of caretaker of the dead. Someone needs to walk dead people through the way this dreamy realm actually works. I think there's a fine tradition of this in many religions and works of fiction. You have Saint Peter at the pearly gates of course, as the guy who says \"What up, welcome to heaven.\" But when I thought about what Aradia was doing here, for me it probably mostly brought to mind the '80s film Beetlejuice.

The fact that I'm not sure indicates this was a sneaky way of getting that information across. There are two main ways you can convey information to readers: exposition dumps by loquacious characters or omniscient narration, or organically folding elements into dialogue like this. Most writers like to favor the latter, probably for good reason, since especially in leaner works a lot of explanation feels heavy-handed, clumsy, and rarely provides the double utility of integrating tidbits of information into conversations which also develop characterization and advance plot action. Personally speaking though, there's an ironic backfire to this tactic if you obsessively treat it as a rule you can't break. If sneaking exposition into conversations and such is all you ever allow yourself to do, it starts becoming conspicuous as a \"rule\" you're following. I'm constantly watching movies where I'm like, oh, here's the conversation where the characters awkwardly try to have natural-feeling banter while educating the audience about some important underpinnings of the plot's premise. Even if it's done well, it still always feels noticeable. You can just feel the gears grinding away in the head of the writer on how to get this info to the audience as smoothly as possible. It's almost painful to observe successful implementations of it, because it blares so loudly to me that it's a \"deeply considered solution to a writing problem.\" After a while, organically embedded exposition starts to feel like you're deploying smooth pickup lines. You know there's an agenda there, you can't UN-know it, so sometimes the more smoothly its pulled off, the cornier it feels. I think this is why I've leaned toward flipping between both strategies frequently, and designating clear agents for unapologetic expository purposes in a way that's pretty up-front about it all, so everyone knows the score. Sometimes it's okay to just EXPLAIN THE FUCKEN SHIT! YOU DONT GOTTA BE SO DAMN CAGEY AND CLEVER ALL THE TIME! Just break some rules, who cares. That being said, we may have already learned the Tumor was in the planet core in an earlier exposition dump, which would retroactively render this entire note a little bit silly."

Time to revisit this idea: Sburb can be seen as a frustrating, antagonistic analogue for life and the challenges it imposes on young people.

If lifehacks are \"hacks,\" what exactly are they hacking if not the traditional prescribed methods of dealing with life's challenges?

For instance, the alert reader might begin to suspect the \"slave\" Mindfang is talking about is Kanaya's ancestor (the Dolorosa). There isn't much to go on, other than her being a lesser blood caste, some allusion to her horn shapes, and sharp teeth. This alone doesn't make a strong case, but the more we start to understand these accounts of ancestor lore are meant to come across as original events which are somewhat being karmically reprised by the young trolls, the less likely it seems this would just be some random troll. And we're getting a look at a guy who obviously is Eridan's ancestor, who's locked in a black feud with Mindfang similar to the dynamic Vriska and Eridan both had during their Flarping days. And now the journal mentions Dualscar ended up killing the slave either out of jealousy, or just some form of all-around Ampora-grade bitchiness. We just saw Eridan kill Kanaya, which loosely matches this outcome. Also recall that Kanaya was infatuated with Vriska for a while, loosely echoing whatever sordid thing was going on here between their ancestors."

The juxtaposition makes it clear that Mindfang et al's old adventures are directly linked to what's going on with these kids right now, and to some extent, with everything we already know about them. It's deepening our understanding of Vriska's character, since now we know she was striving to model her life after this smug lunatic. It reframes a lot of the relationships and interactions we've already seen, like the lopsided Vriska/Eridan rivalry, Kanaya's involvement in that picture, and, as we'll see in a moment, what's been going on with Gamzee recently as well. All this helps convey that the current confrontations are just historical echoes. A kind of karmic follow-through that these kids can't really avoid, due to some mysterious cosmic entanglement with the fates of their ancestors. Whether this linkage is explicit, due to some unknown mystical forces at work, or a little more figurative than that—such as, just a nice presentation device to evoke a sense of parallelism, provide some more depth to these relations as an extension of ancestral legacy, and expand on Alternian lore—is something for the reader to wonder about."

We're simultaneously learning about the existence of previously unknown ancestors and the interrelated lives they led. In the process, we're accumulating more knowledge about Alternian culture through inference, and establishing a pretty sturdy backstory which mythically tracks with current narrative events. So what do you focus on? Maybe what jumps out most about all this is the picture it paints of ancient Alternian life, before the planet was abandoned by adults, turning it into a global daycare facility. The hierarchies and caste-based orders of enforcement start implying a cultural reality that's pretty intense, chaotic, brutal, and full of intrigue. A volatile kind of society which has a certain order to it, and you need to know the obscure ins and outs of all the systems just to survive. And even then it might not be enough. Dualscar thinks he's gaining the upper hand on Mindfang by turning over all the dirt he has on her. But instead of being like \"Cool, this is useful to us to help us apprehend a criminal,\" the Highblood just whimsically murders him because he told a bad joke. Despite the rigorous, caste-based structure of this society, nothing is especially sacred, and no one is ever that safe, even if you follow the rules. This also gives us a better sense of caste roles. Since purples are the highest land-dwelling caste, they end up functioning as the brutal enforcers of all laws pertaining to all lower land-dwelling castes, in any way they see fit, which due to their clowny nature obviously ends up being kind of capricious and not entirely logical. We see many signs later that this is exactly how the Condesce likes it, and she sees great value in outsourcing the mechanisms of authority through these nuanced layers of power, with the nastiest clown-thugs sitting at the top. Even sea-dwellers like Dualscar, who technically outrank all purple bloods as the reigning aristocracy of the planet, still have to defer to maniacs like the Highblood when it comes to navigating the dispensation of authority for all lower castes. Which isn't ideal for them, since clearly engaging with them at all carries some risks. But the Condesce doesn't care if a few high-ranking violet bloods end up getting arbitrarily whacked by her beloved clown muscle. In the end, even though violets are the ruling class, she doesn't care much about them either. All she cares about is keeping her stranglehold on power with this complex, staggered, oppression-based sort of pyramid scheme. Note how it says the Condesce doesn't even know who Dualscar is. That's how insignificant he is, ultimately. Similarly, all Eridan was to Feferi after a while was a tiresome pest. The way that situation played out could also be seen as long-delayed karmic backlash for Dualscar's irrelevance to her, at least from a very Amporan point of view."

The historical echoes from the journal partly help to frame our expectations. It assigns a deeper narrative to the conflict. Like pro wrestling events, the hype is always oriented around establishing a narrative to follow based on the history of the combatants. Framing it in this manner helps hype us up for this stupid showdown that appears to be brewing. It also provides the basis for what an absurd and unexpected twist it is when the true victor appears out of nowhere and kicks everyone's ass.

But the actual content (Dualscar, the Highblood, etc.) wasn't especially relevant until now. All that stuff was fine as material embellishing on the culture, and touching on the ancient ancestral conflicts which are finally about to be addressed through this looming showdown. But the Redglare history is a much more substantive introduction, since it starts targeting the long-standing karmic roots of the Vriska/Terezi rivalry. And if you've been following closely with these notes for the last several books, you know this is the Serious Shit. I've noted before that the entire plot of Homestuck almost seems to revolve around these two, once you start chiseling away at everything to isolate the most load-bearing elements. So if that's true, then it must also mean the Mindfang/Redglare material is similarly central, serving as the initial spark for this plot-critical relationship. The 3x SHOWDOWN COMBO we're about to see functions as the \"resolution\" for the historical drama that was established on preceding pages. And in the same way, bringing Redglare into the picture will provide the backdrop for a much more pivotal showdown ([S] Flip) which brings a sort of resolution to this drama as well. But that's not for a while, and the historical parallels of their feud I'm sure will be better to address on the [S] Flip pages. For now, this is mainly just \"Hey, here's another cool character,\" and \"Oh, I heard you wanted some more sweet worldbuilding? All right, here's some legislacerator stuff to consider.\" In other words, I wasn't totally bullshitting when I started vaguely babbling about legislacerators during Terezi's introduction. They're real, and there's cool stuff to think about here. Okay, actually I WAS bullshitting, but then later I decided to elaborate on the bullshit in this manner. That's an accurate description of what worldbuilding is. Side note: Mindfang talks about peering into her \"oracle.\" Which obviously is just one of Doc's cue balls, which she uses to cheat, just like Vriska. Could it be the exact same one that blew up in Vriska's face? All these kids seem to end up in possession of all the same shit their ancestors had somehow."

John similarly disrupts an extremely dramatic standoff moment by retconning into the scene and knocking Vriska out cold, thereby outrageously undercutting all the carefully laid dramatic and narrative intricacies associated with that moment. (Which is fine, since we already experienced it fully in its untainted form.) I still consider that to be probably one of the funniest moments in the story. This scene is too, actually. Also it barely even \"ruined\" everything, since despite all the ancestral backdropping we did here, these three characters don't even have much to do with each other that would warrant a dramatic triple-reckoning like this. The only one we really have any investment in, when it comes to making a comeback and kicking some ass, is Kanaya. Against Eridan, for obvious reasons. Against Vriska, for... Well, all Vriska really did to her was fail to take her flushed feelings seriously, or even notice them. But still, this moment is about Kanaya reclaiming some dignity and making a statement that she's not taking shit from anybody anymore. So let's not begrudge her some light Serket clocking in the name of her righteous resurgence. And against Gamzee because... Do I even need to explain this?

Turns it into this excessively metaphysical, damned if she does or doesn't moral quandary which leaves her a depressed, guilty wreck for the next several years. Eventually she got the right idea and relayed it to Retcon John via bloody scarf. I mean, sure, it could be that his untethered nature in relation to canon made it a \"safe\" possibility, where for Terezi it was not. On the other hand...maybe not? Maybe punching Vriska is just the universal, ultimate solution to every problem. In fact, it even seems to solve her own problems (remember, Aradia punching her a whole lot is what helped her go god tier). Perhaps we may quantify the entire concept of problem-solving in terms of Vriska punchings. Are you at an impasse in your life, and don't know what the solution is?

So the question again shifts to \"How does Jack come into possession of the wallet, and how do those spots of blood get on the wallet?\" Which is a pretty similar, if not congruent question to \"How did the blood get on his hand?\" And then we remember John is in possession of the wallet, and Jack is on a stakeout for John, having just murdered his father. Then we start to get nervous. As you can see, all it takes to raise tension sometimes is revealing an otherwise harmless fact. Then you sit back, let readers make their own logical leaps of deduction, and let them go \"Oh no...\" on their own.

But I'm pretty sure this was a tongue-in-cheek implication, and not really meant to be definitive proof that's what was actually going on. Kind of in the same category as a light tease? It's a detail small enough that I don't think it counts as much of a revelation at all. Could it be true? Sure, but who knows what she's whispering there. Maybe words of encouragement. Maybe offering a compliment on her fine new hat. Seems like something she would do. She and Terezi have this in common, where they are both on very good terms with their past and future selves. They're strong allies, rather than the ridiculous enemies Karkat insists on making of his other selves. An army of Aradiabots worked together for the common good, despite being doomed. Still, it's kind of an interesting idea that this is demonstrating the mechanism which allows for her to receive messages from dead people. It would mean that ghosts are actually communicating with their memory of Aradia. And ghosts in their bubbles whispering to the memory of a psychically gifted person may serve as a conduit for actual messages being delivered to the real person. It opens up some deep questions. Is your memory of someone linked to the truth of that person's existence in some way? The topic isn't explored much beyond this one cagey whisper. But we do know that in Homestuck, ideas of people and things have a lot of power. Would it be unreasonable to think influencing the idea of a person might hold some sway over the physical instance of that person?\n\nSometimes two dream bubblers have these fairly long déjà vu conversations where they keep \"remembering\" stuff but still don't come to the realization they're in a dream bubble. Aradia (who is the ghost of a dead Aradiabot) and Sollux (who isn't dead, but asleep after being KO'd by Eridan) just keep spinning their wheels here without figuring it out, and chalk the anomalies up to both of them being psychic. They don't actually remember until God Tier Aradia comes along and snaps them out of it. Which is a pretty good illustration of her purpose here in the dream bubbles. Without her around to gently nudge people toward remembering they're dead or asleep, the ghosts would probably stay in this awkward, dreamy purgatory much longer before finally getting on with their new existence in the afterlife.\n\nThe fact that Aradia says she wanted to give them a chance to remember, but the conversation keeps going nowhere, seems to indicate that she's beginning to understand this is actually what her role out here in the bubbles is going to be like. She's learning these confused, lost souls will need some help in prying them out of their dreamy stupor to face reality. I guess that's worth noting, but it also isn't even remotely the point of this scene. The Sollux/Aradia conversation was a gateway memory for what turns out to be a pretty elaborate dream bubble sequence involving many participants which I rigged for the sole purpose of illustrating the Doc Scratch origin story. It turns out to be a good delivery mechanism for communicating a complex series of facts that sprawl throughout much of the known history of the trolls. A cosmic construct that uses people's memories as a medium turns out to be a convenient tool for when you need to revisit some events of the past to fill in the reader's knowledge of important facts at the right moment. (And the right moment is now, since we're about to cannonball hard into the Doc Scratch zone.) Not that there's anything wrong with flashbacks in general, but now that dream bubbles are an established device, doing it this way actually feels like a more organic tour through some tricky expository material than a straight flashback would have felt. -->"

It provides so much utility all at once, and you can condense several different purposes into one scene, which otherwise would have been kind of awkward to duplicate with other methods. Look at the categories of people who can participate in them: 1. Living people who are physically present inside the bubble (God Tier Aradia, and later, many others as well). 2. Dead people who died at any point in the story. 3. Living people who are asleep. This results in a very broad memory canvas for people to exist in, which means you can revisit practically any setting or event from the story. It also means a wide range of people can directly connect and communicate with each other outside of chat clients. People who otherwise would have no chance of talking to each other, or who would have never even heard of each other. A good example of this is Jade's odd appearance here. She isn't going to be contributing to the Doc origin story, because of course she was never involved with any of that. But she is essentially bearing witness to what's going on here, which is an economic way of getting someone from the human crew in the loop on all this, without bothering with clunky additional conversations later (like Kanaya messaging Jade with: Youll Never Guess What Sort Of Amazing Shit We All Just Learned About Doc Scratch In A Crazy Multi Person Dream). She's just there, so she knows already, and that knowledge can be used in more interesting ways soon rather than wasting time getting the knowledge to her. You see this a lot in later uses of dream bubbles. People are asleep, and just happen to be awkwardly hanging around, watching crazy stuff happen, and then they wake up with a whole new set of understandings to work with."

The memos were a strong addition for this reason, broadening the dialogue in a way that felt exciting after Homestuck so doggedly held to its \"only two people can talk at a time\" rule. The dream bubbles channel some of that memo energy, but a bubble with a lot of people in it is more like a Memo Plus. They can see each other, there can be physical interactions, and there can be a wide range of dreamlike settings. But what makes lots of people talking at once really engaging I think is captured pretty well here, which basically boils down to giving all these characters a chance to mercilessly roast each other. That was mainly what was good about the memos too.\n\nJade immediately becomes Aradia's new goth girlfriend. Makes total sense when you think about it. There's brief commentary on Jade's absurd dress, which reminds us this was in her wardrobe for consideration. But remember, these outfit variants were never just about fresh looks and funtimes. They also conveniently help distinguish a character based on where they are on the timeline, and what sort of stuff they're up to while wearing it. Goth Girlfriend Jade seems to be mostly taking naps while wearing this outfit, touring the dream bubbles and meeting new dead trolls (please don't be dancestors, please don't be dancestors...ah fuck, they're probably all dancestors). But why did she choose this as her napping dress? Maybe she just thought it sounded appropriate to wear a goth-looking dress while meeting a bunch of ghosts. I'd buy that explanation."

Does this mean she was actually the one who invented the entire Felt fashion line?! It's not unthinkable, but there are some problems with this theory. For one thing, the color of their suits is the exact same shade of green as Calliope's blood, which Caliborn stole from her to color his words in an act of dominance after having her murdered. So that's the origin of the Felt's association with this color, not Kanaya's whimsical choice here. Which means it's more likely that by giving him this suit, she was just \"channeling\" in some way this aesthetic, which is ominously inherent to Paradox Space itself. She says the puppet remained secure in her block to her knowledge, so unless between now and then someone (Gamzee) snuck into her block and stole it (it was Gamzee), that's where it remained until Jack blew up her Sgrub planet (don't worry, Gamzee rescued him long before that and is snuggling with him as he watches the final countdown on his computer).

Remember that the human kids also had their suppressed-memory wall scribblings which were invisible to them as well. We're finally getting a look at the troll equivalent of that phenomenon, and what purpose it served. Rose's suppressed scribbles were the MEOW code, making her solely responsible for the first guardian DNA sequence which created Bec. But here, it's a group effort between four (+1) people to create the same code (using different letters and numbers standing in for the GCAT nucleotides of course). Trolls always seem to reprise analogous concepts established by the human kids as a precedent, but...bigger. Like the human romance system—a single \"quadrant,\" which is a grid of 1^1 dimensions—for trolls gets expanded to a 2^2 grid, which is 4. There are a lot of such precipitous escalations when it comes trolls, either due to the bigger size of their group, the complexity of their culture, or the intensity of their arc as a group and other surrounding circumstances. Even their First Guardian, Doc, is more intense (cerebrally at least) than Bec. So where the humans had 1^1 people scribble Bec's code, Doc's code had 2^2 scribblers (+1 \"wild card\"). This escalation therefore demands a more elaborate backstory sequence, which is what we're seeing here."

I guess I'll just do what I always do, which is bite the bullet and just say way, way too fucking much about all of this, until every single point is covered and my absolutely vicious case of authorial OCD has been temporarily sated. Sound good? (My youth pastor desperately shakes his head.) Great. Okay! We learn that soon after Vriska used her Sollux-puppet to kill Aradia, Ghost Aradia quickly went to work subconsciously using her telekinesis to scribble the t0ck code with the ash from the ruins of her recently incinerated hive. Then we glance down and see Vriska also subconsciously scribbled her code shortly after her Flarpian revenge cycle-related maiming. So then, if we aren't total jokers, we guess that Terezi likely did the same with her code immediately after being blinded (flip ahead one page to confirm...yep, I'm right). Aradia also prefaced all this by saying they were all being manipulated into doing this Flarp revenge stuff, so all of these gruesome outcomes were both a direct result of Doc messing with them, AND the injuries apparently prompted brief fugue states which made them write the code for his DNA in the first place. The entire debacle had Doc's fingerprints all over it from the start, and with good reason: it resulted in data critical to his ectobiological birth. Next: the nature of the code itself. The MEOW code was simplistic by comparison. It was literally whispered to Rose by a cat, so it's no real surprise that what he said was literally \"MEOW.\" Then later it ironically yielded an omnipotent dog, but let's just file that away as \"humorous\" and move on. But this code is complicated. It is a composite of five distinct code strings, with the GCAT letters swapped out respectively for tiCK, t0ck, 8r8k, H34DS, honk, and HONK (note that 8r8k is only three unique symbols, but H34DS is five, so it evens out to eight total). So that's twenty-four total symbols, but ultimately they all map onto the four GCAT symbols to result in a single DNA sequence in aggregate. In fact, my intent was for this exact same code to be used to create Bec. The idea is, all First Guardians have the same special \"omnipotence DNA,\" which just happens to be expressed in different ways through the brains of the kid players. First Guardians all share this potent genetic code, but are diverse beings due to having different ectobiological components (i.e. dumb dog + code is a very different result from cue ball + Cal + code). God, what a huge load of shit all this is. Whoops, wait. Did I say that out loud? (My youth pastor is nodding vigorously.)

Also, when you consider its relevance to Doc and Lord English, once you know how LE is actually summoned, it all starts seeming almost absurdly literal. But let's look at the code writers. Team Charge (Aradia and Tavros) wrote t1CK, t0ck. Aradia is a Time player, so it makes sense for her. It only squares with Tavros once you take his Pupa Pan lore into account. The previous page said they were \"sounds said to accompany the ultimate demise of the tyrant less an arm and an eye.\" Captain Hook has been used as one of these moving-target symbolic figures. Does it apply to Bec Noir? Vriska? And now Mindfang is in the mix (though we know Vriska modeled herself after her, so there's some inherent redundancy here). But when you examine Vriska's demise later, it does seem to pin her down more concretely as the Hook figure mentioned here. Her death is presented along with the ticking of her magic clock, which was deliberating over her death as either Just, Heroic, or neither, when it's rudely interrupted with a crowbar wielded by yet ANOTHER tyrant less an arm and an eye, Spades Slick. Okay, that's some cool stuff, but back to the code. Vriska contributes 8r8k, which is pretty obviously suited to her. Both in terms of the lucky kind, but more notably in the context of those 8-balls she smashed all the time, which is a cursed gesture that evokes LE's summoning process. Terezi's H34DS makes sense in the context of her two-headed coin, and in particular the slashed head side, which could be seen as a \"broken\" head. Then there's the wildcard addition from Gamzee, which is just honk HONK. What is there to say about this? Dude just says honk a lot, case closed. But when you string them all together, and read it as more of a sentence than a random series of words, it tracks with LE's summoning very closely, which we see immediately following [S] Cascade. The clock in Doc's home is ticking, then stops. Doc, who's lying there as a lifeless puppet, begins growing horrible green appendages. His cue ball head cracks, and then breaks. A triumphant Lord English opens his horrible jaw and releases the Vast Honk.

He really does seem like a wild-card addition. But it starts making a little more sense once you realize Lord English literally honks upon his arrival, which in turn makes even more sense once you realize Gamzee is the only troll who is an actual constituent of LE's nasty soul. Let's pause the clowntalk to track the gaggle of dreamers this bubble has been accumulating. First, there's God Tier Vriska. We know she's been napping, since we saw her harassing WV in his strange morse code furry poem dream. Looks like she just rode that nap wave right into this. There's Terezi, who was crying blood just after she got blinded and somehow hauled herself back up to her treehouse. But the blood disappears when she remembers this is a bubble, and is replaced with her fresh bite marks.

This is one of those small things that's easy to miss, even on a reread. He's actually priming himself for LE to emerge from his body. LE's standard form involves the shredded Hulk-style white pants, the suspenders, and often no coat. But if he does wear a coat, it's the much bigger, infamous one we've seen a few times already. Doc removing his white coat is both practical preparation for the transformation that's about to take place, but also a symbolic gesture, retiring one coat in anticipation of growing into a much bigger one.

          "content": "These Doc/Rose dialogues make for pretty good reading, probably because it's another round of intellectual sparring between Rose and a character who can rise to the occasion, like Kanaya does. But the Rosemary dialogues come across more as two girls engaging in a kind of cerebral flirtation, setting up the basis for future romance. This is just a smug creep harassing a teen online, in a way that is considerably more intellectually suffocating than Kanaya is, along with actual omniscience and supercomputer-level genius to back up his arrogance. But even justified arrogance is still arrogance, which provides a target for jabs and zingers for someone like Rose to execute.\n\nNow that we've officially just confirmed that Doc was derived from Lil Cal, he's taking the liberty of making his similarities more obvious. Don't think we didn't notice that \"haa haa\" you snuck in there, Doc. Remember Cal, when given the chance to speak in sprite form, only has \"haa haa, hee hee, hoo hoo\" to say, over and over. Even though Lil Cal isn't a \"real character\" per se, knowing Doc is part-Cal seems to help characterize him more anyway. Our sense is, despite being inanimate, Cal is a very mischievous and evil puppet. Therefore, so is Doc. Which makes it fitting that Doc launches into some disingenuous-sounding, overly-intellectualized discussion about how he enjoys telling jokes and playing pranks, then later gives us an agonizingly unfunny, very Scratch-branded explanation of how he defines jokes and pranks. He sees them as variations on lies. It's much less about being \"funny\" to him, since as kind of a computer-like being, he probably has no genuine sense of humor. He seems to perceive everything through the lens of facts and falsehoods, and having full command over when certain facts are imparted and when others are excluded. If any facts are misrepresented, the question is for how long, which is a factor that serves as the basis for his understanding of \"jokes.\" It's both a dry, sociopathic interpretation of the concept of humor, but also a pretty informative window into the way he perceives reality. Information is everything, and variations on knowing vs. not knowing certain facts, who to share them with and when, is the ultimate key to power and manipulating others to achieve your objectives. This also doubles as a dispassionate philosophy on storytelling, which is a practice he notably engages in as well.\n\nProbably one of the more jarring later revelations, which retroactively skews a lot of content, is showing Cal's origin as a storage vessel for a bunch of Bad Boy souls. And the jarring quality, perhaps even the \"fridge horror\" if you want to start troping up, is especially evident if you review this conversation. If Cal contains those souls, it means Doc must too. Basically, the shitty male cocktail includes: Dirk + Equius + Caliborn + Half a Gamzee (let's call it the \"bad half\"). It also means those souls are present in Lord English. But we can kind of deduce that certain souls are more dominant in the Doc form, while others surface more in the LE form. It seems pretty clear that while Doc is alive, Dirk and Equius rise to the top, while Caliborn and Gamzee remain slumbering. And when LE is summoned, it's the opposite (which should be pretty obvious, since clearly the guy is just a grown up Caliborn, and unfortunately, he also honks). The Dirkisms running through his dialogue are pretty clear. Aside from the basic tone and intellectual aggression, he also refers to himself as an \"uncle\" figure. (Dirk is technically Rose's father. But the Dirk splinter stored in Cal is actually his Auto Responder Al duplicate, making him more like Dirk's twin, i.e. Rose's uncle.) Then you have a few beats of conversation which bring Equius to mind, such as the creep-factor, the general feeling of humorlessness, and the \"No it's not, Yes it is, No it's not...\" dialogue which is the type of interaction we've seen him have with Nepeta a few times already. -->"

Again, there's too much to keep up with here, so I'll skip over stuff about how Rose'll need to get John to use one of her Quills of Echidna to scratch the Beat Mesa, and keep talking about what an elaborately constructed piece of shit this guy is. I think when the time comes to show the douchebag cocktail stuck inside Cal, there's a brief temptation to regard it as an odd, semi-random melange of characters. But there are several layers of logic to the guys who all combine to form his personality. Much of the logic orbits around these negative traits associated with men, or more specifically, the \"toxically masculine\" aspects often linked to certain male personalities. Dirk has a lot of these traits, which are central to Dave's feelings of tension and abuse concerning his bro. The intellectual aggression, the power of assertion, the knowitall-ism, the mansplaining. That's a lot of Dirk stuff when he's at his worst. Equius shares a lot of those traits too, with some different points of emphasis. Both of them have this creepy-guy streak running through them, with strange or offputting interests, and seem to get a quiet kick out of making others uncomfortable through demonstrations of these fascinations. They are actually pretty similar characters in this way. They have enough differences to make them feel distinct, but the similarities point back to this topic of \"persona alchemy\" I was pushing in some previous books. The idea that there are some elemental or platonic personality profiles in a story, and many characters we see are just permutations and evolutions of those. So one way of looking at Doc's personality composite is just taking this idea another step further. But then, this still doesn't really close the book on the topic, because he also plays the role of the sinister, devil-like alt-author figure, making these character choices seem more meaningful in relation to the idea that all these guys are different spins on dramatized, negative, author-insert figures. Both Dirk and Equius inside Cal are splinters of those characters, offshoot variations of the originals. But I've also talked about splinters in a different context, which is that any collection of characters in a story could be viewed as compartmentalized, somewhat exaggerated splinters of the author's total personality. Everything an author is capable of conceiving is recorded through the characters they create and the words and actions they assign to them, which includes good and evil things. If it didn't include such moral polarities, the results wouldn't be too interesting. Which is why me saying characters like Dirk, Equius, Doc, and a few others exist as dark authorial surrogates shouldn't be taken as overly self-critical lacerations. (Unless you really want to think I suck as bad as they do, in which case I'll just say: fair enough.) I'd say these self-examined qualities are just drawn out, isolated, and inflated both for dramatic effect, and also as critical write-up of those qualities existing within many human beings in general, which I would like to think is grounded in a creative process involving a certain degree of humility about some of this bullshit. I like all these characters here, but that doesn't mean I think their unpleasant qualities are good. It just means I am harnessing and heightening those qualities for creating strong villainous portraits. If you write stuff, then it's very likely you do this as well. That is, carving up the full potential of your personality and endowing your OCS with the exotic results, including your extremes. The only difference between us is you probably didn't have the courage to drag yourself into the story and begin weirdly personalizing many of these decisions, thereby essentially making everything about you, literally constantly, and then writing tons of cool huge notes about it all in later editions."

          "content": "When Doc gets on his high horse about lies of omission not being a thing, I think this is where some of his views as a nefarious alt-author figure start leaking out. If you imagine that his spiel here is being applied to a philosophy on storytelling, it tracks pretty well. Dark alt-author figures in the story always partly make their villainous qualities evident by showing hostility toward the reader or the story itself. There are flashes of this kind of contempt here. Rose is the listener, or the \"fan,\" and has projected certain ideas and assumptions of his judiciously measured dispensation of the truth, or the \"story,\" and making demands of it, coming across as \"entitled.\" Her attitude seems to rankle Doc. Her attitude being, \"There are certain things you know, and I think you have an obligation to tell me.\" But in his view, he doesn't, because everything he reveals and exactly when he reveals it serves a certain purpose. His devious machinations throughout the cosmos are somewhat analogous to the way a writer crafts a narrative. Since he's an author-tier figure with the more negative qualities of a creator brought to the fore, this helps makes sense out of the fact that I included two characters in his personality profile who are exaggerated avatars for negative qualities of the author. And as unpleasant and sinister as Doc can come across both personally and authorially, he isn't the worst-case scenario. He isn't even that much worse than me in terms of things like authorial sadism, jerking the reader around in certain ways, self-indulgence. (Later there's a gag where I'm ambushing him with a broom, and I essentially admit he's only slightly worse than me, which I still think is a pretty funny line.) Dirk and Equius similarly aren't even that unflattering as avatars either. You could do worse. And we do do worse. As far as demonic author-tiers go, English is the true monster. His dominating personality splinters are much worse too. Caliborn and Gamzee are complete hell-people compared to Dirk and Equius. They are also sort of author avatars in certain ways, but with a degree of cartoonishly evil exaggeration. They absolutely comprise the \"authorial wrath\" portion of the total Doc/English personality quagmire. Their negativity isn't like Doc's, which feels mildly contemptuous—it's about pure hatred. They are what make LE's all-encompassing presence feel truly satanic compared to Doc's relatively polite and restrained approach."

Finally we learn the Scratch is a hard reset, not just of the game, but of the universe. Sounds pretty extreme. But this is important stuff, because we now have a real grasp of some stakes and objectives. To have a chance to win, the players need to reset the game. But if they stay here while the reset takes place, they stop existing. So additionally, they have a tricky problem to solve: how to do all this stuff and try to keep existing at the same time. If you've been a complete zealot about keeping track of all story details, you might begin to get some foggy impressions of what a solution could look like. Some pieces are there. Mainly, those 4th walls might start feeling conspicuous as quick access-points to a plane of reality that has nothing to do with the session. But then this starts inviting awkward questions about how much the AH character is going to be directly engaging with the story and characters beyond the little episodes of buffoonery we've been seeing. (Don't worry, I \"reassure\" the readers on this matter very soon, with truly an epic load of JPEG horseshit.) Doc also mentions (on the next page) that they'll need to transport the Battlefield. Planet transportation is another tough problem to solve. But again, if you're an A+ fan, maybe you start thinking about Jade and her untapped space powers. Homestuck provides so many potential solutions to the weird problems it presents. Because there's just so much esoteric junk and overpowered crap in general, it's hard to even decide what to pick. Just getting to the point of finding out \"what is the actual thing that needs to be accomplished\" always seems to be 9/ 10th of the progress we're seeking. So thanks, Doc. Wait, what if... What if this means he was GOOD author figure all along?\n\nOh yeah, then he also suggests they go god tier. It's not a bad thing to recommend to people in general. You know, like, not dying? Like, ever? You really should look into that. Thanks man, I will. But this isn't exactly huge news, because you already knew about god tiers, and you've been desperately hoping all the kids will become god tiers at some point anyway so you can check out their sweet costumes and powers. He also has this really Doc-like, awkward way of interpreting Rose's probability question. There are certain lines where he really sounds computerish, as if he's struggling to think and talk like a limited, mortal being. Obstinate, inhuman-sounding lines like this really make the Auto Responder component stand out. If you're a reasonable person, you're probably rightly assuming I did not conceive of Dirk's Auto Responder before writing all of Doc's text. It's more like Doc's personality and speech patterns began informing the ideas for Doc's deeper origin and true nature, which led to some high-level design consideration for features of Act 6, like the Auto Responder, and even more fundamentally, the voicing and personality of Dirk himself. But having this as an option was only made possible by imprinting some of these qualities on Doc in the first place via this persona alchemy approach to voice-crafting. Since he was already mapped with nefarious alt-author qualities, with a bit of forethought, Dirk could also inherit some of these qualities when I was building his profile. So paradoxically, in the story Dirk is shown to be a seed for Doc, but outside the story it's closer to the opposite: Doc was somewhat of a prompt for Dirk's profile. But that's the way much of the creative process works when it comes to something this big and crazy. The \"planning\" can be hard to pointpoint, and is often diffused over a very long stretch of time as many other pieces all coalesce in parallel. So sometimes people point at wild stuff like Cal being host to four nasty souls, which explains a lot about Doc retroactively, and they'll ask, \"Dude, did you plan that from the start?!\" It's hard to answer, because planning is a fog, the \"start\" is an uncertain idea, and much of these concepts are fungible, complicated, and involve some inspirational redundancies and overlap. With Doc and Dirk, the cart is before the horse obviously. Doc somewhat led to Dirk. But with the Cal issue in total, there are like, five or six different cart/horse pairs. Some of the carts are before the horses, and some of the horses are before the carts, and they're all separated by varying distances. Make sense???? No, it doesn't. You stopped caring the moment I brought up horses, and started cheering wildly. I understand completely."

Possibly because if he does, it might unsettle his slumber inside that cue ball head, and then Doc would have to listen to a lot of bitchy thoughts from a cranky little boy. I don't know if that's actually true or not, but it's a funny idea. He also mentions his own death is linked to an event known as \"the break,\" which tosses another phrase like this into our lexicon salad, like the Scratch, the rift, etc. For one thing, obviously it's a pool term, referring to when you strike the cue ball into the triangle of other balls to begin the game. Which promotes the sense that Doc's death and the summoning of his master is when things really begin, as if saying \"game on\" for LE's reign of terror. But it's also literal, in that Doc's head breaks open to reveal a hideous skull. And we've already read the phrase 8r8k H34DS. We're being completely surrounded by very pointed clues on how all this works. Clues that border on obvious in hindsight, but just non-obvious enough to make it work, I think. I always believed that English was much more interesting as a complex mystery to solve than a terrible menace to defeat. Slowly nursing the puzzle of his identity, then the horror of his reveal sequence, felt a lot more compelling than even any hypothetical final battle involving his defeat. The presumed story structure where at the climax, all our cool heros surround LE, fuck him up, then triumphantly celebrate their incredible heroism, always felt like a comparatively hollow, bland outcome in the context of his true nature and role in the story. I believe there would be a cheapness to such a depiction onscreen, in a way that undercuts or completely disavows the actual meaning behind his presence in Homestuck. I think the issue of \"to show or not to show the ultimate defeat of Lord English\" will always be a controversial topic among scholars of this work. Which I also believe is a good thing. You may be stunned to learn I have some very intense thoughts on this topic. But I REALLY need to save some material to talk about when those late Act 6 and 7 books when all the stuff is actually happening.

I think Doc's creep factor toward girls is most likely channeling part of Caliborn's personality, which almost seems to revolve around his horrid attitude toward women. For Caliborn, this weird combination of wrathful misogyny, yet fixation and obsession with certain girls, is obviously central to the type of real-world profile he's meant to portray. But when his personality is more muted among the collective in Doc's head, those qualities come across as more \"restrained,\" \"polite,\" and \"flattering,\" which arguably just makes it all creepier. The result is a creepy dude profile that also exists in the real world, sort of adjacent to the Full Caliborns out there. There seem to be many stripes of this kind of unfortunate male behavior, which all exists in a broader family of sub-Caliborns. The Docs, the Eridans, the Cronuses...

We are creating the \"yellow yard\" as a new key concept, and a critical unit of measurement for the purposes of quantifying a complex, intangible property of the story. It needs to be a yard rather than a meter, partly so as to match the refrain of non-metric measuring terms appearing as jargon elsewhere in the story. Such as black inches, red miles, etc. But also due to the way a yard (three feet) conveniently matches up with the distance light travels in three nanoseconds."

          "content": "If all you've read is up to this page, by now it's completely fair to wonder if all this self-insert stuff is going to lead to me literally capering around on-screen with my own characters, talking to them, hassling them, helping them, or just being an all-around nuisance for the sake of my own laughs. Not that there would be anything wrong with that. I like to have a good time, you know? But that's probably a bridge just a bit too far for most people, who've already shown saint-like patience by indulging as much of this baloney as they already have. So I'm setting up some terms of assurance here. Almost a sort of contract, or pledge, in which I first define the way a nebulous concept like \"direct author insert meddling\" can be quantified, commit myself to limiting my meddling by no more than one of those units, and then let you continue on with the story feeling vaguely reassured, but also slightly uneasy because everything I'm saying here might either turn out to not make the slightest bit of sense, or I might be outright lying. At the end of the day, it turns out to be a little of both.\n\nWhat an extravagant abomination this page is. I've really outdone myself here. Probably in more ways than one. Note how I echo some of Karkat's words, \"forces which if handled recklessly will nullify the basic ability of intelligent beings to give a shit.\" Which is another way of saying, if the author starts cavorting about onscreen with his own characters, that will likely damage the reader's feeling of immersion and investment, and they will close the tab. So we better make sure that doesn't happen. Which is easy enough to understand. But then it gets pretty opaque. I talk about confining my involvement by a physical unit of measurement, and I even mention how that involvement will be ESSENTIAL(!!!). By saying it will be surgical, I'm saying, \"Don't worry, you'll barely even notice me.\" So while this functions as a reassurance, and you're tempted to be like \"whatever dude\" and just keep reading, there are some troubling questions that linger here. Like how the hell is the yellow yard actually going to represent my intervention later? Furthermore, am I even telling the truth? Or if I'm not actually lying, are there forces beyond my control which cause my best-laid plans to backfire? This is closer to what ends up happening, which is in keeping with AH's arc in general, as the buffoon-god of the story. The supreme, megalomaniacal master of his creation, yet always seeming to be at its mercy as it spins out of control all around him. Ultimately, the yellow yard is traversed by our heroes in a ship at the speed of light, which should only take three nanoseconds. But due to absurdist asspull reverse-relativity logic, it ends up taking three years instead. So what was supposed to be only a \"surgical\" three-nanosecond slice in the story turns out to result in a massive three-year gash, where the kids age up, flounder around the ship in boredom, and play the Ghostbusters MMO. So while my original intentions may have been sound, clearly the traversal of the yellow yard turns out to be anything but \"minimal intervention.\" In other words, it all ends up being just another big goof. :o)"

If you bother researching Terry Kiser, you'll find he's the guy who played Bernie in Weekend at Bernie's, a movie in which some dumb bros spend all weekend parading an old dead guy around as if he's alive, to facilitate some sort of ruse.

We are SO CLOSE to understanding everything, and yet the full explanation remains elusive. Jake also subtweets Jade a little there, but presumably the Jade as an old woman who taught him this spacey stuff. One thing he doesn't allude to is that Calliope was involved in this bunny-making collab, which in hindsight maybe causes us to raise an eyebrow at the red- and green-eyed design.

          "content": "Here's a neat trick I played on everybody. [S] Seer: Descend began like an an ordinary animation, leaving you no reason to expect otherwise. It opens with this heavy mood-setting piece of Rose dropping from the storm clouds, all hopped up on revenge from her recent orphaning, and looking for trouble. But the moment she touches down, it switches to become another playable RPG game. Suddenly you realize you have to control Rose yourself to see the rest of the action.\n\nIf I recall, this was also the final RPG game of the story, until deep into Act 6 when we start seeing Meenahbound games (which, despite being RPG games technically, still feel like they're in a different category from these). Maybe this was the last one of these games I did because this one felt like the peak usage of the format in a lot of ways. The integration with a Flash intro, its use as a narrative-advancing tool, and the way it puts the reader in a position that feels kind of complicit in marching your heroes right into what you already know will be a traumatic outcome. There's a lot going on with this one, and I think the emotional beats it hits, the mood, and the general sense of anticipation are all unusually sharp by any Flash page's standard. Even though I never fully saw this story through a reader's eye, I remember after making this that I stopped to reflect on how this whole sequence really \"felt\" like something.\n\nI would make some remark about how this is an unusually melodramatic entrance Rose is making on account of her grimdarkness, except the truth is this is probably pretty close to how she came downstairs to have breakfast with her mom every morning.\n\nDue to the abstract format of the RPG mode, and the fact that you're in control now, you don't get to see how Rose actually reacts to this horrific murder scene. You just have to imagine it. Or you could take what you're seeing here literally, which also works. As if Rose were regarding all this very stoically, too focused on revenge to do anything but Terminator-style march through this castle looking for Jack.\n\nThis game also seems to involve more walking than usual. Hey, castles are big! Now let's get ready to enjoy the epic fight Rose is about to have with Sans Undertale.\n\nWait, Sans isn't in this game. Not sure what I was thinking. Pretty much the only thing in this castle is a bunch of chess guys, who are all either dead or scared. An unseen Jack lurks through the castle, taking care of the latter group. And not by offering them comforting reassurance, if you know what I mean. ;-) (He kills them all with his sword.) ;-)\n\nHey, just because I ripped those stained glass window assets specifically for use in the stupid Zillyhoo Flash a few pages ago doesn't mean I can't repurpose those exact assets in a much more serious Flash which uses a completely different rendering style. Did you know this is mainly how all this stuff got made so fast? Just constantly opening up some recent garbage, grabbing some garbage inside the garbage, and pasting the old garbage into the new garbage. And it pretty much always works fine, if not quite well. It may be the ultimate strength of my process. My sense is that many other people would get hung up for hours on little creative decisions that often took me seconds to solve.\n\nThis Flash probably does more than any page before it to begin framing (mostly through subtext like this) the greater structure of Homestuck's remaining narrative. These banners include little excerpts we recognize from earlier for each of the four kids. The title \"They Wait\" begs the question, who is \"They\"? That would be the four Alpha Kids in the post-Scratch session, waiting for our four heroes. The emphasis placed on \"waiting\" is a nod to the way a significant part of Act 6 plays out—the Alphas enter their void session and have to spend a lot of time waiting around for these four legendary heroes who will be able to bring their session to life. There's a sense of waiting on both sides though, as the Beta Kids have to complete a long journey to the new session. So we see that the inevitable session scratch has been woven into carapacian lore from the start, as is hinted at with these banners. Similarly, all the lore inside the Alpha session seems to totally revolve around the fact that its heroes (nobles) are waiting around for their counterparts before they can do anything significant. These two sessions each seem to have a kind of symbiotic mythos. They relate to and depend on each other to make sense.\n\nThe lines for each banner are just reprisals of the false quotation segments each kid got much earlier. The \"pimp's in the crib\" line comes across as a pretty good punchline. But since we've gradually been learning more about Lord English, and in particular the way Dave will continue to be portrayed as being destined to clash with him, it starts becoming tempting to associate this phrase with English himself. Could the pimp be LE? It's not far off from how he operates. He uses a variety of women as slaves in his service. What's the crib? Could it be Cal? A cradle of sorts for the soul of LE to incubate until he's finally ready to emerge? Damn, this really adds up. Kinda spooking myself here.\n\nThis guy thanking goodness for pillars is just a dark setup for a punchline later where you come back here to find him dead and the pillar sliced through.\n\nEven the dang yellow yard is stitched into their legends. Unbelievable. This brief riddle hints at the solution to the looming scratched session problem and how it involves my shitty ruler. It says they need to \"cross\" the yellow yard, suggesting it is a physical distance which must be traversed. Hmm. At the other side of that traversal \"He\" (the genesis frog) finds the pond in which He's meant to squat (a new Skaia in a different session). And this destination existing \"through broken glass\"... I'm not sure what else that could make you think of except the 4th wall. Yo, I'm sitting here thinking, like, you can figure this out??? This was a totally crackable mystery pretty well in advance of when all this stuff finally happens.\n\nIt's kind of funny that this carapacian tome considers the idea of more than four orbs to be preposterous. It acknowledges the theoretical possibility, but beyond that they just think it's silly. Sburb is a flexible game that can go in infinite different ways, but once a session is locked into specific conditions, the inhabitants all seem to believe those conditions are totally normal, and any other conditions sound insane to them. It's kind of like how we have the ability to imagine different laws of physics in our universe, but actually picturing them put into practice and how that would affect life seems insane and completely fantastical. Yet perhaps there are different universes with different physical laws regardless. How would we know?\n\nThere's no way Rose didn't just pocket that queen porn.\n\nOkay, what aisle of the library did Rose just wander down?! There sure is a lot of problematic trash on these shelves.\n\nTurns out WV has a fandom. He should be very proud. Unfortunately his fandom is rapidly shrinking.\n\nLooks like the Rose x WV ship has just SET SAIL! (Dozens of lively sailors manning the S.S. Rosemayor spring into a delightful choreography in celebration of their romance.) Good work, boys, I love the energy I'm seeing. Why does Rose always seem to get the best crack ships? There is nothing to do but accept this fact about her completely, and update your grids accordingly.\n\nOnce you find John, you can move a statue off a transportalizer and teleport back here in order to minimize the retreading you have to do through the castle. Very nice of me to offer this shortcut. Also, notice the bloody footprints scattered about. This is how you know you're on Jack's trail. I don't know how his feet got coated in that much blood though. You'd think he could only produce two or three bloody tracks before it ran out. I guess blood just really sticks to Jack for some reason. That hand sure stayed bloody a long time as well.\n\nWay too many of these huge, majestic chess beasts are being cut down in their prime. This is easily Jack's greatest atrocity. I can barely even bring myself to look at \nthis page.\n\nIt's kind of unclear what's going on here. You follow the footprints until you catch a glimpse of Jack, but he's in the process of vanishing just as you reach the top of the stairs. It's a shame Rose isn't also leaving a trail of bloody footprints. That way if someone later saw the two sets of prints, and saw one of them suddenly disappear, they might conclude \"That was when Rose Lalonde was carrying Bec Noir.\" Wow, quite a sentimental moment between them. Another crack ship, anyone? You got it.\n\nAnother way this Flash begins boldly hinting at the remaining story structure is with these curtains. I almost feel like it's hitting you over the head at this point. First you go through four red curtains (Acts 1-4).\n\nThen a blue curtain (Act 5 Act 1), then another red one (Act 5 Act 2, which is what we're reading now). -->\n\nThen we get to a big record platform, allowing you to teleport. This pretty obviously symbolized the Scratch we are building to at the end of this act. The teleportation reflects the fact that we can't seamlessly proceed to the next act, that it will involve some fancy footwork to somehow shift the players from one plane of reality to another (which, thanks to the excerpts from that tome earlier, we are now guessing is a process that entails \"crossing the yellow yard\"). -->\n\nThen we keep walking up and encounter more curtains. But this time, they aren't red, they're green. We get the sense that Act 6 will be very different terrain, just like Hivebent was, which also had non-red curtains. Also, there are a lot of them. Six in total, which we can infer to be act subdivisions, a structure we've already been introduced to with A5A1 and A5A2 but is obviously going to be taken even further now. Subdividing Act 6 into six sub-acts suggests a certain degree of recursive self-division, which maybe also hints the subdivisions will go even further than this, sending us asymptotically spiraling downward into hell (666). But will it go that far? (Yes.) Also: the first five green curtains are already open, but the final one is closed. What does this mean? It means these sub-acts will be iteratively repetitive of the story structure we have already read, starting over with new characters in an Act I-like situation and advancing similarly until we get to roughly the state of endgame complexity we're at now. The first five curtains exist because those parts of the story will exist. We will get to read those parts, but the Beta Kids won't be able to participate because they won't have arrived yet. They will arrive toward the end of the full Act 6 arc, which means in a sense that all of those curtains will already be open for them. The only one they need to open will be the final one, as they get closer to making their grand entrance near the endgame state and reunite with their estranged teen guardians. Really, this couldn't be more obvious unless I typed this entire paragraph verbatim and pasted it directly onto the final green curtain. -->\n\nFinally we end up on a white Skaia platform. White, because that's the color of Act 7. Skaia, because that's the final destination of the frog containing the universe the players create. By entering Skaia, Rose has essentially traced the path of the magic tadpole and impregnated Skaia. But it turns out John was already waiting in here, looking for his dad. So did I just imply that...Rose just got John pregnant? No, wait, that makes no sense on any level. Also there's enough ship-teasey garbage in this game between these two as it is, without me stirring the ol' Grimdork Mpreg Pot.\n\nAlso note how this exchange immediately establishes that John can't understand Rose's broodfester tongues. Another brilliant ploy by me, sidestepping any real, gratifying, in-person conversation between two human kids. Her grimdark gag order serves several purposes here. First, it's just another way to milk the agonizing sense of dramatic irony this RPG game emanates. Rose can't tell John their parents are dead, so she has no choice but to lead him to the bodies while he cheerfully babbles on as if nothing's wrong. It also delays the more friendly conversation they'd have if she were normal, which would result in a lot of standard banter that just wouldn't be hitting the right note for this scene.\n\nIt also lets John seem extra-dumb, which is always a nice bonus, and it gives him enough slack to let him talk himself into some awkward corners, thus stoking the shipping fires. Not that this is actually a worthwhile objective, but the kids like it. I may have had some harsh words for this ship in the past, and I will stand by the position that it seems boring. Or maybe...it's not? What if Rose's grimdark condition salvages the ship? Okay, I can buy that. Then they get married, and have to learn sign language, because Rose keeps spewing nonsense forever. Then they have inter-grimdark kids, who speak half gibberish and half... Wait, nope. This ship still sucks actually.\n\nJohn starts doing the thing where he's talking to Rose like he's trying to figure out what a dog is trying to say. Except she isn't even part-doggy like Jade. Actually it's quite possible he's still just flexing more of his internalized sexism. John Egbert: literally the worst male in Homestuck? It's likelier than you think.\n\nThe velvet pillow makes a comeback. It also resurfaces at various points in Act 6, which suggests Rose develops a long term habit of using it as a therapeutic object during her moments of psychological angst. (Then Gamzee steals it for some reason.)\n\nBehind the white platform is a statue of the White Queen and King. I'm not really sure why this was here. Just a place to put a nice asset, I guess? The symbolic implication seems to be that once the universe is created, WK and WQ get to live their happily ever after too. But we know that can't happen. Maybe it was just a nice fantasy they entertained, and immortalized through a hidden statue. Maybe they talked about it a lot, what their peaceful lives would have been like for them if they got to live in this new universe too. Wow, that's about as sad as it gets.\n\nReally flagrant ship tease. Pretty outrageous. Especially considering we know Rose has already been successfully crack-shipped with practically every carapacian in the story. WK (he loves her fic, remember?), WV (she was recently swayed by tales of his heroism), WQ and BQ (Rose is a lesbian, and they're both sexy queens)... I could go on. But I don't need to. We both know this all just WORKS.\n\nJohn, just stop. You're starting to piss everybody off.\n\nJade's loyalty-based Jack armor even applies to her banner. Bad dog, best friend.\n\nYou know how sometimes you're walking up a really long staircase with someone in total silence, and to make things less awkward you just start babbling about anything at all to break the silence? John randomly starts talking about how they should get married. Pretty smooth, huh?\n\nTo be fair, Rose's pleasant expression suggests she may be receptive to the idea. Then again, her words may literally translate to \"Sorry to disappoint you, John, but I'm currently in love with a gay alien.\""

          "content": "When you find the murder scene, that triggers the end of the game. John gets a vaguely sad look on his face, and the kids strike cool poses to begin what surely will be a very intense and long-lasting round of battle. Except for the fact that, outside of any logical reasons for the battle to be cut short, you know this is going to be a bullshit fight scene fake-out because I hate making battle scenes because they're a huge stupid waste of my time and energy no matter how \"cool\" you end up thinking they are. I'm insanely right about this, and cutting this battle short so I could go right back to writing long conversations between Dave and Terezi was absolutely the right call. Fanboys always wanted me to do more cool fight scenes and got grouchy when I didn't. It's one of the many reasons why so many fanboys of a certain ilk are completely terrible. Actually, in many ways a great deal of the thematic focus of Homestuck as a piece of metafiction revolves around my contempt for certain kinds of fanboys, which should provide a lot of material for discussion in the Act 6 books. Sounds great, right? Of course it does, and I know you can't wait to hear all of my good shit when it comes to the gratuitous write-ups on Caliborn-meta that is in store for you. In fact I would go as far as saying that much of HS, and Act 6 especially, reads as sort of an allegorical poison pen letter to the worst types of fanboys and their deleterious effect on the media they consume. It dispenses repudiation by profiling them psychologically, determining what they value most in media (i.e. in relation to the meat vs. candy binary), and strategically turning the screws through various acts of deprivation, fake-outs, long indulgences antithetical to their most cherished \"values,\" and so on. If you could boil down my relationship with the \"shitty fanboy\" archetype via HS, all you really have to do is skip forward to the part in A6 where I'm talking to Caliborn through his giant computer and tormenting him by gluing his mouse to the desk, blaring loud music he can't mute, etc. That scene says it all about my ongoing relationship with these guys, and the manner in which I generally felt inclined to \"serve\" them through my work.\n\nBut that's all kind of a huge tangent in the context of the current scene. Bottom line: John gets insta-stabbed from behind by a teleporting dog with lightning-fast reflexes. Jack's been getting angrier the longer he's been sniffing John's scent without being able to follow it. He probably just didn't want to take any chances in letting him get away this time. Also he's super powerful and John still just sorta sucks? He gets better, though. Later while sleeping, Dream Hologram (?? I'll have to work on a term for that) John gets a rematch and holds his own pretty well. Anyway, this death doesn't stick, obviously. It's neither Just nor Heroic. So this cheap insta-slaying also serves as a good excuse to start demonstrating the mechanics of god tier resurrection.\n\nThe blood-spreading pattern is a callback to...the very first page of this book! Same exact wound from the same exact sword. The first from the front, the second from the back. Jack is great at stabbing John but bad at killing him.\n\nRose is pissed. Okay, this DEFINITELY means we're going to see a big awesome battle now, right? Right???\n\nActually, no, she just blows up the entire castle immediately, almost certainly incinerating the corpses of Mom and Dad, making funeral plans a lot harder. Roxy would be absolutely dismayed at this squandered opportunity for a grand, double-open-casket funeral. Revenge-looney grimdark Rose just doesn't THINK.\n\nWhat a drama queen."

Remember this moment we briefly glimpsed in Aradia's dream bubble? \"When are we going to get around to engaging with that content?\" you probably wondered. Well, it is now time to engage with that content.\n\nTerezi is having a hard time understanding what Dave is trying to communicate, which is that it is very possible to have nuanced and difficult to express feelings of sadness when complicated or abusive individuals become deceased. Some may wonder, if you really hated this person and they caused you so much trauma, why not be glad they're gone? Not everyone will feel this way though, and the reason probably has to do with the intricacies pertaining to the long-term psychological effects of abuse itself. Dave just masks with humor some thoughts which are clearly too difficult to describe, and is probably uncertain of himself. Then he starts babbling about keeping his lips sealed unless he's presented with a cryptodick or something, which obviously isn't gay at all and means nothing about his sexuality."

I'll just point out some lines on the previous page which get to the heart of it. \"TG: taking it vertically means drawing more blood / TG: but horizontally means a clean break.\" In other words, unbroken sword (conventionally heroic path) means more blood, more trauma. Broken sword means subverting or renouncing that path, embracing less aggressive tendencies, and eschewing bloodshed, even at the expense of one's \"destined\" call to heroism. Even though we keep seeing additional points to this long-term broken/unbroken sword theme (like how Dave has to break the Royal Deringer to retrieve it, and does so effortlessly), I don't know if any of these future submissions add more depth to this idea than I've already talked about.

But this makes sense, since we know Red Suit Dave, after that moment, decides to take a break from all the Terezi talk and moves on to full-time Jade duty. So there aren't many other places on the timeline this could be. We are just nonlinear-storying back to this moment because it happens to involve a setting and subject matter that is appropriate to what's going on in the story now, and we can hear a bit of psychological embellishment on guardian death and other such recently germane issues. That's kind of how nonlinear story sequencing has to work. When you have \"all events\" to choose from, what do you pick to show, and when? Usually the best answer is \"the scene, subject matter, and moment in time which best serve to elaborate on the current focus of the narrative\".

Terezi's also looming gravely over the Nepeta corpse, using the powerful method of \"confirmation bias\" to shore up her Vriska verdict by observing the damning evidence at her feet. Never mind that it's absurd Vriska would leave that stuff there if she killed Nepeta. Also never mind that there's a trail of Gamzee blood right there, making it clear he's pinning his murder on Vriska just to mess with Terezi. The funny thing is, much later when Retcon John stands in this exact spot, he immediately sees through the entire ruse while knowing barely any of the context.

When Terezi says His Tyranny will \"clear this courtblock,\" she probably just means he will literally eat everyone in attendance.\n\nTerezi sets forth her major moral and friendship-based ambivalence about killing Vriska for the greater good. Which is a conundrum that most of the meteor action revolves around for the rest of the act, and that their entire mutual arc revolves around for the rest of the story, to a great extent. It's also another one of these conversations that puts the focus on the fact that \"these are all still just kids.\" And all the overblown stuff about murder and violence stemming from their culture mostly amounts to a lot of big talk. But underneath that, they're just scared, insecure kids who have always been afraid they can't hack it in their aggressive society. Vriska had that long, indulgent conversation with John, which he mostly nodded along to, where she finally opened up to somebody about fears like this. So this is basically Terezi's parallel version of that conversation. Except notice how instead of her conversational partner nodding along like a dweeb, going \"Golly, Vriska, maybe it IS okay you killed all those people!\" Terezi has had to spend most of the time trying to convince Dave to stop talking about himself long enough for her to share her feelings."
